conservation manufacturing our products to finished packaged goods and maintaining our highest standards around safety, quality, and sanitation, all  while providing a comfortable and secure environment for our employees to work, can consume significant amounts of energy. in this type of interdependent environment, we know many opportunities exist to reduce energy consumption through operational optimization. we are on a journey of continuous improvement to identify our opportunities in this area and capitalize on them. our kraft heinz manufacturing facilities across the globe have been undergoing a significant digital transformation to improve the tracking and efficiency of our energy and other utility usage onsite. for example, in   our kirksville facility in the u.s. conducted a steam trap digital monitoring pilot to improve energy efficiency by better detecting any steam track failures, which are commonplace at the site. the new digital, infra-red system solution helped technicians spot steam failures early and better utilize their time on other critical plant needs instead of manually troubleshooting any failures. the  pilot successfully improved energy efficacy and the company is looking to expand this pilot to other high-use steam facilities.    another key example of our energy saving initiatives  is at our cairo facility. approximately   percent

plants. the pilot was made possible through our collaboration with materials recovery for the future (mrff), a non-profit research collaborative that set out to determine the technical and economic feasibility  to collect, sort, bale and recycle flexible plastic packaging. in  , we installed more roof board at our granite city, illinois facility, increasing the use of post-consumer recycled packaging by   times as compared to our   pilot. we look forward to exploring additional ways at scaling innovative packaging solution initiatives like these. moreover, at kraft  heinz we are committed to engaging in industry-wide efforts to promote packaging circularity, aiming to strengthen the demand for recycled plastics throughout the supply chain. as such, we are proud inaugural members of the association of plastic recycler’s residential film demand champion program. final installation of recycled roof at the kraft heinz site  in holland, michigan   together at the table: kraft heinz   esg report                 a more sustainable cap the heinz brand released an innovative and more sustainable cap for   its squeezy sauce bottles, made to be fully circular. the unique new  cap – made of an innovative single type of material – was created after we invested significant research and development, involving more than  ,  hours to find a suitable replacement cap for our convenient and extremely popular squeezy bottles, which sold one billion units globally in  . we created   different designs in total on the mission to create the new  cap, which were printed in-house using a state-of-the-art  d printer. after creating the prototypes, we then followed a rigorous testing procedure to make sure the cap met the highest quality standards. to date, heinz   sauce bottles have used a flexible valve, which had been designed to deliver the ideal portion of sauce per squeeze but was typically challenging to recycle. the new innovative cap has been designed to provide the same perfect squeeze of your favorite heinz tomato ketchup using a single, rigid and more recyclable material. this resulted in the cap - and the heinz tomato ketchup bottle – being easily and conveniently recycled alongside other household curbside recycling. the first heinz varieties to get the new cap will be the world’s most-loved ketchup, heinz tomato ketchup, and the popular heinz bbq sauce. the  cap is expected to be rolled out globally from  , starting in europe. appendix environmental stewardship responsible sourcing healthy living & community support appendix introduction

table: kraft heinz   esg report                  appendix environmental stewardship responsible sourcing healthy living & community support appendix introduction supplier guiding principles at kraft heinz, we recognize our suppliers as partners and want to bring them to the table to advance the  sustainability agenda. our supplier guiding principles (sgps), which we strengthened in august  , apply to our upstream supply chain and clearly define both our minimum requirements, as well as our aspirational destinations, for the conduct and sustainable operation of our supplier network. our sgps are more robust than ever before. the principles will help us to drive sustainable growth within the organization, mitigate risk and bring value to an array of important stakeholders, while we ensure that we are all doing our parts to create a better, more just world. these principles continue to be included in our standard contract language and are publicly available in   languages through our supplier hub .  our sgps were developed using industry best practices and internationally recognized standards, including the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights, the international bill of human rights, and the principles set forth in the international labor organization’s (ilo) declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work. in  , kraft heinz also launched a supplier facing version of its ownerversity e-learning platform which includes supplier-specific training on the new sgps. this training is a foundational resource in developing existing suppliers and onboarding new suppliers into the kraft heinz ecosystem. the training is available in   languages.  together at the table: kraft heinz   esg report                  appendix environmental stewardship responsible sourcing healthy living & community support appendix introductiondue diligence program  our supply chain spans globally and touches the lives of communities around the world.  it is our responsibility to make sure the impact of our operations remains a positive one. we take a risk-based approach to due diligence aligned with the un guiding principles. this model complements our sgps and defines how and when risk will be monitored, assessed, and managed. compliance to our esg due diligence program, including our right to audit, is a contractual obligation for kraft heinz suppliers globally. we continue to assess risk levels for our key sourcing categories and will  continue to increase our audit capabilities and scope over the next few years. progress on this program will be covered in future reports.  in  , kraft heinz joined as a member of sedex and ecovadis in an  effort to align its supplier esg requirements with industry standards and recognize existing supplier efforts to manage esg risks. we value impact-driven action and are actively developing our responsible sourcing program in a way that harmonizes supplier requirements and reduces administrative burdens on our suppliers – allowing our teams to focus resources on driving esg improvements in areas that need it most.    human rights in  , kraft heinz released a global human rights policy , which  is guided by internationally recognized standards, including the  united nations guiding principles on business and human rights, the international bill of human rights and the principles set forth in the international labor organization’s declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work.  as part of the global human rights policy, kraft heinz requires all  employees and related entities, suppliers and business partners to strictly adhere to our human rights standards, which, in summary:   • prohibit child and underage employment  • prohibit trafficking, forced or involuntary prison labor  • prohibit all and any forms of abuse, bribery, harassment and discrimination  • recognize and respect the rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining  • recognize and respect fair, legal and equitable work timeframes, working conditions (including health and safety) and wages  • recognize land rights, natural resources and ensure all workers’ rights to clean water and adequate sanitation facilities  • require all labor recruitment and employment procedures to be carried out in a legal and ethical manner following the release of the global human rights policy, kraft heinz undertook a global human rights risk assessment with third party assistance. this exercise highlighted relative risk factors by commodity type overlaid with associated geographical risk. the evaluation also included economic and social criteria to determine points in our value chain where risk is highest, and where we could make the greatest impact. the scope of the assessment was all-encompassing – rather than only evaluating specific commodities, we assessed nearly all our ingredient food purchases. this assessment is influencing our plans to continuously develop and improve our due diligence and management programs. we began to develop plans to roll out our two prong approach, working collaboratively with our value chain toward proactive capacity building, identifying areas where we can collectively make improvements, as well as targeting specific elevated-risk procurement categories, with enforcement actions if necessary and segmentation based on:  • type of supplier (strategic, core or transactional) • risk categories and materiality • geographic risk integrated with other risk categories as a result of this assessment, we updated our supplier guiding principles in  , strengthening the human rights sections, including new risk areas such as land rights, migrant workers, minimum age of employment, fair wages and ethical business practices. in addition to this, we established the esg due diligence and management program. this program helps us monitor our supply chain for potential human rights risks and non-compliances with the help of sedex (direct suppliers) and ecovadis (indirect suppliers). kraft heinz values all life. we have a zero-tolerance approach to human rights violations across   our entire value chain.  together at the table: kraft heinz   esg report                  appendix environmental stewardship responsible sourcing healthy living & community support appendix introduction supplier diversity program the kraft heinz supplier diversity program was launched in   as an important step in embedding our company values into our supplier base to better reflect the communities that we serve. starting with the u.s., the program is intended to play a critical role in addressing systemic barriers which may stand between under-represented groups and the opportunity to be a supplier to kraft heinz. kraft heinz is committed to the fair inclusion of diverse suppliers in procurement activities and will partner with diverse suppliers that are at least   percent owned, operated, and managed by women, people of color, lgbtq+ people, persons with disabilities, veterans and other recognized minorities, with a goal of tripling spend with such companies by  . the company will continue to partner with small businesses and those suppliers certified by the u.s. small business administration’s hubzone program, which fuels small business growth in historically underutilized business zones.    palm oil kraft heinz recognizes that unsustainable palm oil production  is one of the largest drivers of deforestation globally. we have taken active steps to address these issues in our supply chain. we (including through legacy heinz prior to  ) have been a proud member of the roundtable on sustainable palm oil (rspo) since  , a multi-stakeholder nonprofit aimed at uniting all aspects of the palm industry to minimize the negative impacts of palm oil cultivation.  the baseline risk assessment of our direct global palm oil  supply chain conducted in   allowed us to identify potential deforestation risks, as well as peatland/biodiversity hotspot encroachment concerns. direct suppliers were additionally asked to provide information on the country of origin of their palm raw materials, as well as their sustainable/ responsible sourcing policies. details on their sustainable palm oil objectives and progress were also shared. suppliers were also asked to provide traceability data for all palm oil mills in their supply chain. the mills’ geographical location in conjunction with a global satellite mapping tool incorporated potential deforestation and other environmentally related risks in the mill sourcing regions. the information obtained from this exercise informed our global sustainable palm oil policy ,  and allowed us to engage our suppliers to discuss any identified risks and develop action plans to manage them.  : h.j. heinz holding corporation becomes a member of the  roundtable on sustainable palm oil.   : kraft foods group, inc.

we have an unwavering commitment to the care of animals in our supply chain. although we neither own nor manage farms, we align with our suppliers in requiring their animals be treated with care, understanding and respect. kraft heinz believes that good animal welfare includes three elements  which guide our animal welfare policies and initiatives:  • health and productivity: healthy animals that are provided with quality shelter, feed, and water  • emotional well-being: negative experiences minimized and positive experiences enhanced  • naturalness: animals perform important species-specific behaviors  this concept of animal welfare builds upon the internationally recognized “five freedoms” of animal welfare which include the fundamental principles of  ) freedom from hunger and thirst,  ) freedom from physical and thermal discomfort,  ) freedom from pain, injury or disease,  ) freedom to express normal behaviors, and    ) freedom from fear and distress.  we support housing designs that allow animals to perform species- specific behaviors. examples include, but are not limited to, cage-free housing with perches and nest boxes for laying hens and group housing for gestating sows. when painful procedures need to be performed, we encourage pain mitigation, such as the use of anesthetics or analgesics. kraft heinz expects its suppliers to implement practices and pursue continuous improvement consistent with the five freedoms and good animal welfare.   source  %  of eggs globally from cage-free    or better* hens by  .   source  %  of eggs in

        appendix environmental stewardship responsible sourcing healthy living & community support appendix introduction* kraft heinz defines “cage-free or better” eggs as sourced from laying hens that come from cage-free, free-range, pasture-raised, or similar natural or open housing settings. complete:  %  public interest in farming and animal care is increasing and  consumers desire farming practices that match their values and expectations. good animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and healthy people form an interconnected system; and well managed farms reduce waste and provide a safe, nutritious food supply. knowing this, we integrate science and societal ethics in our animal welfare decisions. in  , we released our updated global animal welfare policy and our inaugural supplier implementation guide which are available on our supplier hub . animal welfare outreach and education  in  , we worked with dr. kurt vogel at the university of wisconsin, river falls to establish an undergraduate research internship program. the students in this program worked with academic and industry experts to develop supplier questionnaires on dairy calf management, broiler transport, and their swine welfare programs. our animal welfare specialist partners with suppliers on animal welfare improvement projects, such as developing a customized turkey load-out and transport audit. they serve on the animal welfare committees of the north american meat institute and the national turkey federation. within kraft heinz, our specialist provides training on farm animal production and welfare to cross-functional team members and leads our esg steering group subcommittee on animal welfare.our supply partners our suppliers are our partners in humane animal care and its continuous improvement. we expect suppliers to maintain strict standards of animal care and raise animals in accordance with the laws and ordinances in their locale. we require our suppliers to have a zero-tolerance policy for animal abuse and neglect, and to train all individuals working with or around live animals accordingly. in addition to the global animal welfare policy, animal welfare expectations are delineated in the kraft heinz ingredient supplier quality expectations manual and product specifications. when evidence of non-compliance exists, kraft heinz may suspend the supplier until corrective actions have been implemented. suppliers who do not align with the requirements or do not make continuous and positive improvements to meet them risk losing kraft heinz as a customer.a culture of animal welfare  (cont.)    together at the table: kraft heinz   esg report                  appendix environmental stewardship responsible sourcing healthy living & community support appendix introduction    animal health & management laying hens  the ability to engage in normal behaviors such as walking, nesting,  and dust-bathing is important to laying hen welfare. therefore, by   we are globally committed to purchasing only cage-free eggs or better. kraft heinz defines “cage-free or better” eggs as sourced from laying hens that come from cage-free, free-range, pasture-raised, or similar natural or open housing settings. hens in both cage-free and free-range housing are provided with litter, perches and nest boxes. in  ,   percent of the eggs and egg products* we purchased globally were cage-free or better. whereas in previous years our reporting was limited to internal manufacturing only, for the first time for  , we are reporting on progress at both internal and external manufacturing plants that make egg-containing products for us. in europe, we achieved our goal to exclusively purchase free-range eggs at internal plants by the end of  . in the u.s.,   percent of our cage-free egg supply was certified by american humane certified or  certified humane. pigs  in accordance with our three elements of animal welfare, we believe  that pregnant sows should be safely housed in social groups with enough space to perform normal behaviors. the industry faces challenges to meet the demand, especially for pork that complies with strict regional legislation. kraft heinz is working with our pork suppliers to transition pregnant sows from gestation stall housing to group, pen housing. in  ,   percent of our global and   percent of our european pork supply came from sows housed in pen gestation  systems. broiler chickens  we have committed to improving broiler welfare by  . we continue  to incorporate leading science into our assessment of broiler welfare, while we engage with the industry at-large as it redefines its guidelines for enhanced broiler welfare. we will incorporate a combination of outcome-based and practice-based metrics that are shown to demonstrably increase animal welfare. targets include stocking density, litter quality, enrichment provision, and controlled atmosphere stunning and will incorporate supplier verification, such as auditing. we continue to engage with our united states supply partners in meeting enhanced broiler chicken welfare standards.european chicken commitment  in late  , kraft heinz expanded its animal welfare commitments  to improving chicken welfare by   as part of the european chicken commitment . kraft heinz continues to assess and work  to transition its european supply chain accordingly. though this commitment faces some challenges related to supply, we remain steadfast in our commitment to require   percent of the fresh, frozen and processed chicken in our european supply chain to meet this standard. we look forward to continued engagement with our suppliers toward this objective. dairy cattle we require our u.s. suppliers to follow the national milk producers  federation’s farmers assuring responsible management (farm)  animal care guidelines . this program establishes best on-farm animal  management practices and includes second-party evaluations and  third-party verification.   percent of our dairy supply comes from u.s. farms. our canadian suppliers follow the national farm animal care council’s code of practice for the care and handling of dairy cattle. third-party audits are required to ensure that the u.s. and canadian programs’ guidelines are followed. humane endings we believe animals should be provided a respectful and humane death. compromised animals must be euthanized in a timely manner that aligns with the  american veterinary medical association  (avma)  or world organisation for animal health’s  (woah) guidelines.  similarly, slaughter should also align with these guidelines. efficient stunning prior to slaughter is important for animal welfare.   percent of our u.s. oscar mayer product suppliers report that they comply with our product specifications which require an annual third-party humane slaughter audit and regular internal animal welfare audits. antimicrobials disease prevention strategies such as husbandry, hygiene, and vaccinations must be the primary defenses against animal disease. however, even with excellent care, farm animals sometimes become ill. when this occurs, antimicrobial treatment (including antibiotics) can be an important component of humane animal care. therapeutic   antimicrobials should only be used after careful review by a veterinarian and treatment limited to ill and at-risk animals, treating the fewest animals possible. alongside good farm management, responsible antimicrobial use can help protect food quality and enhance safety. in the united states, where the majority of kraft heinz meat ingredients  are purchased, we require our suppliers to meet or exceed the  avma  or  woah  guidelines for the judicious use of antimicrobial agents. our meat  and dairy products meet or exceed government regulations related to the use and administration of antimicrobials, including compliance with bans on antibiotics for growth promotion. hormones while studies conclude hormone supplements in cattle are safe for animals and for humans, we support ongoing research efforts to further demonstrate the safety and usefulness of supplemental hormones. for example, recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbst) is a hormone that can increase milk production in dairy cattle. globally its usage varies widely in accordance with government regulations. in the united states, for example, hormones (including rbst) are not allowed to be used for growth promotion in pigs or poultry. in some countries, growth hormones are approved for use in beef and dairy cattle. we do not restrict their use in those instances. however, we support wider, industry initiatives to eliminate rbst from the supply. testing of food ingredients kraft heinz does not support or condone the use of animals for research that is not essential to food safety, and we do not maintain any testing facilities. when required by governmental agencies, ingredient safety testing is completed by accredited third-party facilities following appropriate animal welfare guidelines. we do not support unnecessary testing and are advocates for replacing animal testing with other validated research methods. together at the table: kraft heinz   esg report                  * kraft heinz does not directly purchase any shell eggs. appendix environmental stewardship responsible sourcing healthy living & community support appendix introduction annually, all kraft heinz suppliers of animal and animal-derived products are requested to complete an animal welfare risk self-assessment. the assessment was  developed by a cross-functional internal panel that included animal welfare, procurement and quality team members and was reviewed by an external team of animal  welfare scientists. the assessments review suppliers’ strengths and weaknesses on animal welfare policies, personnel training, transportation, stunning methods and  auditing. kraft heinz’s animal welfare team works with lower performing suppliers, which make up a small percentage of our total supply chain. together, they create  action plans to develop policies and procedures that improve animal welfare. low performing suppliers unwilling or unable to improve animal welfare may jeopardize  their status as kraft heinz suppliers. results of our   assessment are listed below and more

agriculture in all of our products. through the work of our experienced agronomists and procurement teams, we are proud to work with our suppliers to advance sustainable agriculture practices, knowing that these commodities are integral to our business and to the well-being of our consumers and communities in which we operate.  at kraft heinz, we have a long history of working with growers to promote sustainable agricultural practices, such as implementing rotational crops to promote multigenerational fields, to increase yield at the field and in processing, adoption of next generation breeding through our seed business, and finding ways to help increase water efficiency.  through thorough research in our laboratories and with experienced agronomist teams on the ground, we strive to stay at the forefront  of sustainable agriculture, applying what we learn through trialing and demonstration to additional parts of our business. the kraft heinz sustainable agriculture practices manual forms the foundation of  our engagement strategy with growers, as we work towards our   goal to source   percent of tomatoes for heinz tomato ketchup sustainably. we aim to dig deep in our

spain and california, key growing regions for heinz tomatoes. in the coming years, we plan to roll out audit programs to ensure supplier compliance with these standards and will be expanding the scope of our sustainable agricultural program to navy beans.    building the regenerative capacity of agriculture through a global, farmer-centered,   industry-led initiative. the long-term resilience of agriculture now depends on how quickly we can develop regenerative practices that benefit soil health,  biodiversity, water supply, climate resilience and livelihoods. in late  , kraft heinz, along with approximately   companies from across the agricultural value chain, became a founding  member of sai platform’s new regenerative agriculture programme. the purpose of the program is to build industry alignment, reduce duplication and amplify impact through the creation of a universal framework with locally implementable indicators, to ensure accessibility and applicability of regenerative agriculture principles, practices and outcomes on farm. the program will work to scientifically validate regenerative principles, engage with farmers and develop a mechanism for corporations to verify and communicate regenerative targets to external stakeholders.  “as we develop and define new regenerative agriculture approaches, it is the farmer’s inherent knowledge of the land, its constraints and opportunities, that is critical  to ensuring successful social and environmental outcomes based on solid economic foundations.” – martina henry, director, agriculture sustainability, kraft heinz
