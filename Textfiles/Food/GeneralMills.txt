since our founding more than    years ago, general mills has been  guided by the belief that doing good  and good business go hand-in-hand.  today, we’re more committed than  ever to ensure the g in general mills  stands for good — for the people we  serve and the planet we depend on.  standing for people in  , we refreshed our company  values to drive clarity and unity of  purpose for all our employees going  forward. our updated values — win  together, continuously innovate,  champion belonging, and do the right  thing, all the time — reinforce who  we are, how we treat each other, and  what we aspire to be as a company. this past year we have made progress  against our ongoing commitment  to diversity in leadership and talent  acquisition, including an increase in  the percentage of people of color in  leadership roles across general mills,  and an increase in the percentage of  women on our board of directors.  our focus on standing for people  extends across our business — from  the farmers who grow our ingredients  to all workers in our supply chains.  we are accelerating action to respect  human rights to positively impact all  the people we depend upon — and who  depend on us. in  , we updated our  supplier code of conduct to include  expanded protections for human rights. standing for planet our business also is inherently dependent  on the earth. we know that a healthy  planet is critical for our company to  continue making food the world loves,  yet the negative impacts of climate  change are widespread and severe. we  recognize that we must regenerate the  world’s resources, strengthen ecosystems,  and build community resilience. we have focused our efforts in three  priority areas where we can have the  greatest impact — climate change,  regenerative agriculture and packaging.  in  , we laid the groundwork for  our climate roadmap and invested  in resources and capabilities to drive  progress toward our ambitious goals. we  continue to lead the industry in advancing  regenerative agriculture by partnering  with farmers, advancing science, and  measuring outcomes. we also invested  in a groundbreaking partnership to  establish a state-of-the-art flexible  film recycling plant in minnesota.  to improve the integration of  environmental, social and governance  (esg) priorities into our business, general  mills formed a global impact governance  committee, which is accountable  for ensuring our global responsibility  programs are resourced, on track, and,  ultimately, achieved. i lead the committee,  and i’m joined by a highly engaged  group of cross-functional senior leaders.  we convene the committee regularly and have strong engagement and  oversight by our board of directors. in our  rd year of reporting social  and environmental performance to  stakeholders, we remain committed  to disclosing our progress, as well  as our challenges. we continue to  support key global efforts to advance  the sustainability agenda, including  the united nations global compact,  which we have endorsed since  . our scale brings both opportunity  and responsibility, and we are more  determined than ever to ensure the g  in general mills stands for good. while  plenty of work remains to be done, i am  incredibly proud of the progress we have  made and am energized by the strategies  we have in place to continue advancing  our commitments for people and planet.  sincerely, jeff general mills global responsibility     our business is dependent on mother nature. we are working from the ground   up to solve today’s food and agricultural challenges to build a resilient future. regenerative agriculture    general mills is working   to advance an ecosystem   of good on farms and  ranches — and measure   its

general mills global responsibility     one important way general mills is  investing for the future is through our  commitment to standing for good.  as a member of our global impact  governance committee (gigc), myself  and other general mills leaders help  ensure our people and planet efforts  are integrated across our enterprise,  from our day-to-day investment  decisions to our long-range planning. across our finance function, we  are diligently working to ensure  our financial planning and capital  management practices incorporate  our environmental, social and governance (esg) commitments.  i’m especially proud of our efforts  to align a portion of our company’s  financing with our commitment  to address climate change. n   in april  , we became the  first u.s. consumer packaged  goods company to put in place a  sustainability-linked credit facility.  by entering into this agreement, we  receive a pricing adjustment based  on measured progress in two key  areas: reducing greenhouse gas  emissions and using renewable  electricity for our global operations. n   in october  , we announced our  inaugural sustainability-linked bond,  making us the first u.s. investment  grade consumer packaged  goods company to execute this  type of green financing bond. these innovative financing structures  demonstrate our commitment to  taking urgent action against climate  change by embedding sustainability  into the fabric of our operations. as we continue to look beyond our  annual planning cycle, we need to  understand the risk of climate change  to our future business results. as a signee and supporter of the task force  for climate-related financial disclosure  (tcfd), we remain committed to  providing our stakeholders with relevant  information on climate-related issues.  a summary of our approach can be  found within the planet section of our  global responsibility report, as well  as through our annual cdp disclosure.  from driving topline growth to  creating cost savings and a more  resilient supply chain, we believe that  integrating our esg efforts across  the enterprise is not only imperative  for people and the planet, but also  drives value for our stakeholders.thoughts from our chief financial officer kofi bruce chief financial officer general mills  % of our company-owned production   facilities are global food safety

details and definitions on these and other metrics. general mills global responsibility     environmental, social and governance issues in  , we partnered with pivot  strategies to conduct an update of our  esg issues assessment. we created  and distributed a survey to more than    external and internal stakeholders,  who were asked to assess the relative  impact of each issue based on two  dimensions: external impact (the impact  that general mills has on society and the environment from each issue) and  internal impact (the impact of each  issue on the company’s performance  and enterprise value, considering  factors such as revenue, expenses,  reputation, risk, capital investment,  market access and financial reporting  impacts). the results of the survey  were aggregated, and the issues were placed into tiers based on their relative  impact on the two dimensions. this esg issues assessment and  prioritization helps guide our strategy  and reporting and has enhanced our  understanding of what stakeholders  feel are currently the most impactful  issues for our company to address. we recognize that all of the issues assessed  are important and interconnected, and  do not view this assessment in isolation,  but rather in conjunction with our  broader business strategy and priorities.  for more information on this assessment,  including definitions and boundaries  for each of these issues, please refer to  our   global responsibility report. n    climate change n    food safety and quality n    health and nutrition n    ingredient sourcing n    packaging n

stakeholders to accelerate progress  on social and environmental initiatives.  our approach includes open dialogue,  collaboration and transparent  disclosure. this strengthens our ability  to balance business and societal  interests; build robust relationships  globally across sectors; and ultimately,  identify innovative solutions that  create shared, sustainable value.  we are working to address shared  issues — such as health and nutrition,  racial equity, climate change and  water stewardship — so collaboration  is essential to achieving long-term,  enduring progress. we work with  other companies and organizations to  shape standards across the consumer  packaged goods industry, which  elevates overall sector performance.  we engage on issues that are material  to our global responsibility strategy  and where we can have a substantial positive impact. when engaging with  stakeholders, we assess potential  alignment on objectives, organizational  expertise, capacity, influence and  willingness to collaborate. for example, to advance regenerative  agriculture, we are engaging  stakeholders across the value chain  including the u.s. and state departments  of agriculture, trade associations,  peer companies, retailers, nonprofit  implementing partners and academic  institutions. we engaged senior officials  at the usda on how the government  can support farmers who want to  pursue regenerative practices. we are  extending those conversations to the  states by partnering with the national  association of state departments of  agriculture. we are also working with  walmart and peer companies to advance  regenerative agriculture through policy  levers ahead of the federal farm bill.  general mills supports the united nations (un) sustainable development goals (sdgs), and we focus on the goals that align with the company’s priority issues and areas   of long-standing commitment, investment and progress. n   food security n   food waste n

other partners  to grow our collective impact in  targeted issue areas, while engaging  our employees through volunteerism. leadership and governance: general  mills philanthropy and community  engagement programs are led by the  chief sustainability and global impact  officer with support from a team of  experienced specialists who steward  the company’s philanthropy. in addition,  employee councils located across our key  global operating communities — general  mills “hometowns” — help to inform our  local grantmaking by recommending  nonprofits to be considered for grants. general mills philanthropy is governed  by the global impact governance  committee, which includes the company’s  chairman and chief executive officer and  leaders from law, finance, r&d, supply  chain, marketing, strategy and growth,  communications, and innovation functions. targeted impact: to ensure general mills  philanthropy is well informed and effective,  we use an outcomes-based approach  to help strategically target and advance  solutions in priority issue areas. led by  managers on our global impact team and with input from other internal and external  subject matter experts, we leverage the  evidence base to develop logic models  for each of our priority issue areas that  clearly define: the end outcomes (social and environmental) we are targeting;  the key activities and interventions that  best support those outcomes; and the  key measures we will use to assess our  impact and progress along the way.philanthropy and community engagement philanthropic global focus

the resources and capacity of individuals  from those communities to be the guides  and champions of new and better futures. in everything we do — from our farmer- focused regenerative agriculture work  around the globe in regions where  we source key ingredients (see pages   - ); to our work with the minnesota  business coalition for racial equity in  our world headquarters community  (see page   ); and our founding of  partners in food solutions, a multi- company initiative taking aim at food  security in africa by sharing knowledge and best practices with emerging food  companies (see page  ) — we believe  that a people-centered approach  unlocks the deepest understanding  of social and environmental issues  and systems, and is in fact key to  designing better, more regenerative  solutions for both people and planet.r our philanthropy work is strongly aligned with many of the united nations sustainable  development goals (sdgs), including goals  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . general mills global responsibility     at general mills, we actively engage in  public policy issues that are important  to our company and stakeholders.  we are committed to conducting  these activities in an accountable and  transparent manner. we articulate  our approach in the public policy for  the greater good area of our website.  our public policy priorities include: n    protecting and preserving our planet: 	w  leading on regenerative agriculture  and soil health — general mills is  a leading voice on regenerative  agriculture. we invest to help  support farmers as they shift  toward more sustainable practices  and encourage collaboration and  investment by governments and  the private sector, such as our  support for the foundation for  food and ag research (ffar), a  critical facilitator of public private  partnerships between industry and farmers. policy is a critical  tool to advance this work. we also  encourage the u.s. congress to  strengthen collaboration between  organizations, components of  our supply chains and domestic  agriculture producers to meet our  ambitious sustainability goals.  	w  combating climate change — we  have established industry-leading,  science-based targets for carbon  reduction and advocate for climate  change policies. we support a  comprehensive, national climate  policy; joined ceres’ lead on  climate   day calling for action;  have publicly called for the u.s.  to remain in the paris climate  accord ; and support the u.s.  environmental protection agency’s  (epa) clean power plan. see a  list of our public actions here. 	w  supporting stronger organic  standards — we work to promote  and protect the integrity of  organic standards and advance  their continuous improvement.  learn about our support for the  national organic standards  board (nosb) and the organic  agriculture research and  extension initiative (orei). 	w  advancing water stewardship —   we engage policymakers to  drive more sustainable water  practices in key watersheds,  like california and kansas. 	w  addressing packaging and food  waste — we promote policies to  effectively and efficiently increase  packaging recycling rates and  reduce waste. in the u.s., we are a  leader in ameripen — the american  institute for packaging and the  environment — and are actively  engaged in multiple coalitions aimed  at reducing food waste and loss.  n    delivering nutrition: we work to  advance nutrition priorities, including  support for strong dietary guidelines  for americans and strong u.s. school  nutrition standards, and advocate  for nutrition standards aligned  with scientific recommendations  in the supplemental nutrition  program for women, infants and  children (wic), particularly that all  breakfast cereals be whole grain. n    ensuring safe food: we strongly  support the food safety  modernization act (fsma) and  its goal of raising food safety  standards across the food value  chain. we have consistently called  on congress to continue adequate  funding for fsma implementation. n    increasing food security and  strengthening communities:  increasing food security — at the  federal level, we are a longtime  supporter of the congressional  hunger center, and we work with  numerous partners to advance  policy at the state level.	w  protecting people — we advocate  for inclusive public policies  and add our voice to help lead  change, including for inclusive u.s.  immigration and lgbtq+ policies.  	w  strengthening our communities —  we develop important community  partnerships that drive economic  growth, increase connections and  improve equity. for example, we are  a leader in the minnesota business  coalition for racial equity (learn  more in the people section of  this report) and have advocated  for the minnesota legislature  to enact policing reforms. n   informing consumers and  increasing awareness: we support  public policy efforts to inform our  consumers about our products. for  example, we voluntarily labeled  our products for the presence of  bioengineered (be) ingredients in  the u.s. before it was required by  law, and we continue to do so. n   compliance: we comply with all  lobbying regulations where applicable  and file regular reports on our  lobbying activity. general mills is  registered as a lobbying entity at the  federal level for the u.s. house of  representatives and u.s. senate and in  the states of minnesota and california.public policy general mills global responsibility     the general mills global

well-being of our consumers. nutrient-dense foods: nutrient density  is the per-calorie proportion of beneficial  nutrients in a food against nutrients  to limit. nutrient-dense foods are  important contributors of key nutrients  and food groups, including whole  grain, dairy, fruits and vegetables, nuts  and seeds, and vitamin and minerals,  while balancing nutrients to limit, such  as sodium, sugar and saturated fat.  at general mills, we provide a diverse  portfolio of products, including many  nutrient-dense foods like fortified whole  grain cereals, low-fat and nonfat yogurts,  granola bars, and frozen fruits and  vegetables, that can help consumers  meet dietary recommendations and  build healthy eating patterns. fortification: we fortify key products  in line with public health principles  including using evidence-based  decision-making to help guide the use  of nutrients in our foods. general mills periodically assesses population nutrient  intakes using nationally representative  dietary surveys to ensure our products  help meet consumer dietary needs. affordable and accessible: we believe in  providing affordable, accessible nutrient- dense foods that people love, such as  ready-to-eat cereal, low-fat and nonfat  yogurt, canned soup and vegetables, and whole grain granola bars. many of these  products, in addition to being widely  available in traditional retail outlets and  online, meet the nutrition standards for  u.s. federal nutrition assistance programs  (see related story on the next page).general mills is aligned with helping to reduce  population sodium intakes and supports the  u.s food and drug administration’s (fda)  recently released voluntary sodium-reduction  targets. we have a long history of significant  sodium-reduction efforts, including our    commitment to reduce sodium by  % in    key u.s retail product categories, which we  achieved in  . we are currently assessing  where our products fall relative to fda’s sodium  guidance, and building and activating plans to  continue our journey toward further reduction.  our sodium-reduction efforts also expanded  globally. as members of the international food  & beverage alliance (ifba), general mills and  other ifba member companies developed the  first-ever collective commitment by the food  industry to implement globally set standardized  targets for sodium reduction in manufactured  foods, which was launched in december  .  building on decades of members’ individual  efforts and experience in sodium reduction,  ifba members commit to global sodium  reduction with standardized, stepwise voluntary  targets for key categories of products to be  achieved incrementally by   and  .  the full commitment can be viewed here.   to help us continue

consumers  make informed dietary choices. all  of our product packages display  accurate nutrition labeling and  follow relevant nutrition and health  claim requirements as prescribed by  regulations in the country of sale. our commitment: as a member of  the international food and beverage  alliance (ifba), general mills has made a  commitment to adopt a common global  approach to nutrition information on  packaging that includes, at minimum,  the labeling of calories on front-of-pack. this initiative was implemented globally  during  –  to inform consumers  about specific product nutrition  attributes. in countries with front-of-  pack labelling requirements, we adhere  exclusively to the local regulation. we  also commit not to place any regulated  health or nutrition claim on a product  unless it meets the criteria set forth by  the regulations in the country of sale. our progress: around the world,  our product labeling meets local  regulatory requirements while remaining  consistent with our global approach.  examples of our compliance with local  and regional guidelines include:  n   australia –  % of our products  display nutrition intake information  in front-of-pack labeling, consistent with the australian daily intake  guide and ifba requirements.  n   brazil – all general mills  package information complies  with local regulations. n   mexico –

consume lower-calorie,  nutrient-dense foods that support their  growth and activity. learn more about  our commitment to maintain the highest  standards for responsible marketing. in all media and regardless of the  intended audience, we design all our  marketing to comply with applicable  law and we fully adhere to the  requirements of the international  chamber of commerce framework  for

marketing  policies are reviewed and updated  regularly by our company’s responsible  marketing council and reviewed  with the company’s chief executive  officer and other senior leaders of  our u.s. and international operating  units. the responsible marketing  council is responsible for drafting and  issuing marketing policies, ensuring  full compliance with the policies  through training and other initiatives,  and holding advisory reviews of  all new product development and  brand marketing plans for products  that will be marketed to children. global commitment: in all markets  around the world, general mills  has committed to not direct any  marketing to children under   for  any product unless that product  meets strict nutrition standards.   one of the ways  we make this  commitment is  through ifba, where  we are a founding  member of the ifba responsible  marketing commitment, which  mandates nutrition standards for child  marketing. in addition to the ifba  commitment, which applies globally,  we also adhere to comparable local or  regional commitments in many markets  around the world, where such programs  exist. in the united states, for example,  we are a founding and longstanding  participant in the children’s food and  beverage advertising initiative (cfbai),  which is operated by the better business  bureau. similar to ifba, cfbai has set  nutrition standards, and we commit to  refrain from directing any marketing to children under age   for any product  that does not meet these standards.  in any market where we are a member  of such a program (or where specific  regulatory requirements exist), we  apply the nutrition standards that are  applicable in that jurisdiction. in all other  cases, we follow the ifba commitment  nutrition standards, thereby assuring  that our commitment is global. our compliance track record with these  programs is extraordinarily strong.  cfbai, in particular, publishes a report  annually that addresses the compliance  of all of its participants. we are not  aware of any instance of noncompliance  by general mills in the past several  years, and cfbai has confirmed this  in its reports. in the unlikely event of  any instance of noncompliance, a core  function of our responsible marketing  council is to address such issues and  determine appropriate corrective action. beyond our commitments under the  programs noted above, we have made  additional responsible marketing  commitments that exceed industry norms. for example, we have adopted  industry-leading standards regarding  the responsible use of social media  platforms. we do not, in the context  of any child-directed communication,  encourage children to visit any social  media service for which they are too  young (according to the terms of  those services), nor do we use our own  presence on these social media platforms  to direct any communications to children. we have also long committed to refrain  from marketing food to children in  schools or at school events — and this  commitment applies to all schools,  even middle schools and high schools.  this commitment covers all forms of  marketing (beyond the identification of  the brand and product on menus and  packaging). for example, we do not  depict or display food brands, products  or logos on posters, signs, scoreboards  or school equipment, nor do we market  foods by distributing product samples or  branded merchandise in schools. there  are no exceptions to this commitment.  in the u.s., we operate the box tops for  education™ school fundraising program which, through sales of our   products and those of many other  companies (often nonfood companies),  has provided us$  million to  schools since the program’s inception  in  . though schools are the  beneficiaries of this program, we  refrain from marketing the program  to school children (whether inside or  outside the school environment).we collect and use consumer personal  data for a variety of purposes, including  to provide recipe-related publications to  consumers who subscribe for these, to  run sweepstakes, contests and loyalty  programs, to ensure that our advertising  is directed to relevant audiences, and  to otherwise improve our product and  service offerings. we are sensitive to the privacy concerns of our consumers and  are fully committed to complying with  regulations, including the eu general  data protection regulation (gdpr)  and  the california consumer privacy act. in addition to meeting changing legal  requirements in this area, general mills  is committed to acting responsibly and  transparently to continue to earn and maintain the trust of our consumers with  respect to our collection, retention and  use of personal data. we also maintain  safeguards to control against the loss  of personal data or the unauthorized  access, use, disclosure, destruction or  modification of personal data. learn  more in our data privacy

food       planet       people our approach: at general mills, we are  committed to increasing transparency  about our food. we recognize that  consumers, regulators, investors and other  stakeholders seek information about our  products and processes. consumers want  to know what’s in their food, where it  comes from and how it is prepared. they  also want assurance that food has been  grown and harvested in a responsible  and sustainable manner that respects  people, animals and the environment. we continue to increase transparency by  providing information to key stakeholders  when and where they need it. for example,  to help consumers learn more about what  is in their food, we provide information in  multiple ways — on packages, through  our company and brand websites, on  our brands’ social media channels and  on third-party sites, such as e-commerce  and transparency platforms. in addition,  we actively support public policy efforts  to inform consumers and increase their  awareness about our products — these  efforts are detailed on the public policy  for the greater good page of our website.product information: we provide  consumers with answers to questions  about

consumers.  we also enroll products — especially  our organic products — in the u.s.  non-gmo project, a nonprofit  organization that provides information to consumers and third-party verification  for non-gmo food and products. ingredient sourcing: we are committed  to sustainable sourcing of the ingredients  used in our products, and we regularly  share information about our progress.  for example, we disclose information  about our purchase of roundtable on  sustainable palm oil (rspo) certified  palm oil volumes on our website along  with an updated list of all our palm  oil suppliers down to the mill level to  facilitate transparency and accountability  in our extended supply chain. details  about our ingredients, how they are  sourced and how we engage with  farmers are included in the ingredient  sourcing content in the planet section  of this report. to provide transparency  about the way our ingredients are grown,  we feature details on product packaging,  including some of our annie’s macaroni  and cheese boxes and epic beef bars. biotechnology: the safety of our  products is our highest priority, and we  find broad global consensus among  food and safety regulatory bodies that  approved bio-engineered crops are  safe. we agree with the un’s world  health organization (who) that the  development of bio-engineered crops  and derived ingredients offers the  potential for increased agricultural  productivity and improved nutritional  value that can enhance human  health and development. we have  been disclosing the presence of  bio-engineered ingredients on our  u.s. packages since  . globally  we will continue to comply with  all labeling requirements in every  market in which we operate. pesticide use: we recognize that some  consumers and stakeholders have  concerns about the use of pesticides. in  today’s global agriculture system, where  plant pests and diseases are responsible  for losses of   to  % of all food  production, farmers rely on pesticides,  fertilizers and other tools to protect crops.  as a key participant in this system, food  safety is always our number one priority,  and we maintain a comprehensive system  of controls and processes to ensure the  highest level of product quality and safety.  we have long been a leader in sustainable  agriculture practices that  reduce  the need for pesticides to be used in  agriculture. we detail our work in this area  on our comprehensive pesticide, food  safety and ecosystems health web page.transparency our first muir glen canned green tomato product — petite diced

inherently dependent on the earth and its natural  resources. we know that a healthy planet is critical for our company to continue making  food the world loves. unfortunately, the negative impacts of climate change today are  widespread and severe. this past decade was the warmest ever recorded, bringing with  it extreme weather events that create real business challenges for us, from distribution  disruptions to lower ingredient yields. climate change, coupled with growing demand,  compels us to evaluate how we increase resilience, for the planet, people, and our business. but i’m happy to say that we are stepping up to this challenge. led by our newly  formed global impact governance committee (gigc), we are adapting our enterprise  operating model to transform how we work to achieve our ambitious goals. it’s  imperative we progress with scale and speed to reverse the negative impacts of  climate change and support mother nature’s return to health. this is no longer solely  the responsibility of the central sustainability team; it’s the work of many. sustainability  must not be siloed from the business, but inseparable from it. early work of the gigc has enabled further prioritization of our global impact  initiatives. while general mills has established many important commitments, we are  differentially focusing on and investing in three areas where we have the capabilities  and processes to drive the largest impact for society. those priority commitments are  reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain, advancing regenerative  agriculture, and designing our packaging to be recyclable or reusable. while we are in the early days of integrating global impact into the business and across  key functions, we know we need to drive systemic change if we aim to hit our goals,  and we believe these new structures and clear prioritization will help to accelerate  progress toward our ambitions. thank you for your interest in our work to create a

mills, we recognize that  dairy is a significant contributor to our  greenhouse gas footprint and to global  emissions overall. we also know that dairy  is important in the context of water as it  relates to water quality and manure and  nutrient management. that’s why we  are taking a leadership role in creating —  and expanding — programs in dairy to  improve the impacts of dairy on animal  welfare, farmer profitability and climate. in north america, our regenerative  agriculture pilot program started with  three dairies in michigan, and we have  since expanded significantly throughout  the great lakes region and canada.  our partnership with the national fish and wildlife foundation (nfwf)  helps to expand the scale and reach of  our impact through partner projects  that advance regenerative agriculture  implementation and water outcomes  (see map). understanding the enormous  potential in dairy, we continue to target  our main supply sheds and to create  programs appropriate for each geography  and context. in late  , general mills  launched its first regenerative agriculture  pilot in europe to support farmers who  supply milk for häagen-dazs ice cream. our new partners in quebec, logiag and  regeneration canada, are supporting  scaling regenerative agriculture to another  important supply shed for general mills. in the coming year, we will launch whole  farm ghg modeling to improve data  on a variety of management practices  and dairy systems (including manure),  with a focus on finding greenhouse  gas and financial “leaks” in dairy farm  systems to reduce environmental impacts  while saving money for the farmers.  regeneration canada advances holistic  farmer engagement and leadership to  ensure that regenerative agriculture  reflects farmer needs and whole-farm  context. we are working closely with  suppliers in all three dairy supply sheds  to identify farmers ready to advance  regenerative agriculture and whole farm  ghg modeling on their dairy operation.example: positive impacts of regenerative dairyin  , general mills launched a goal to  sustainably source   priority ingredients by   . while we achieved this goal in  ,  our work continues to ensure access to high- quality ingredients as well as to manage the  social, economic and environmental impacts  of our ingredients. through the results of  our sustainable sourcing work, we learned  that we need to take a holistic approach to  regenerating ecosystems and advancing human rights in order to more fully actualize  opportunities that catalyze change. this  begins with understanding how systems —   such as climate, agriculture, water,  biodiversity, and farming communities —  are all interconnected and how we as a  company can positively impact each. with that knowledge, we have evolved from  individual ingredient strategies to programs that help regenerate the planet while also  creating positive outcomes for people. to  the right is how we have shifted our focus  for the   sustainable sourcing priority  ingredients. please refer to the regenerative  agriculture, eliminating deforestation, water  stewardship, human rights and animal  welfare sections

recognizes the risks that climate change  presents to humanity, our environment  and our livelihoods. changes in climate not  only affect global food security but also  impact general mills’ raw material supply.  this in turn affects our ability to deliver  quality, finished product to our consumers  and ultimately, value to our shareholders. nearly half of the greenhouse gas (ghg)  emissions and   percent of water  use throughout our value chain occur  upstream of our direct operations, in  agriculture, ingredients and packaging.  this is where we can achieve the greatest  reduction in our environmental footprint  while ensuring the long-term availability  of ingredients and improving the climate  resilience of farming communities. effectively addressing ghg emissions,  reducing climate change impacts and  doing our part to tackle food security  challenges requires an innovative, holistic  systems approach. agriculture presents  a complex challenge, given volatile externalities like weather, market demand  and viable adaptation choices. risks vary  according to crops, growing regions and  local markets. an effective approach  requires continuous learning and  adjustment as well as balancing multiple  interests such as environmental impacts,  food security and farmer livelihoods.  our climate policy establishes the  broad framework from which specific  targets and action plans will flow. our goal general mills was the first company to  publish a full value chain goal approved by  the science based targets initiative (sbti),  in  . in  , we published our climate  commitment in alignment with  .  degrees  celsius guidance. that guidance was  set by the scientific community to limit  further planetary warming and minimize  catastrophic outcomes, like crop failures,  biodiversity loss and water scarcity. our commitment is to reduce absolute  greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain* by  % by   (compared  to  ) and achieve net zero emissions  by  . as only a small portion of  our ghg footprint is from our owned  operations, our goals go beyond our walls,  addressing scopes  ,   and   emissions. fiscal   progress: general mills is  focused on advancing work to reduce  our climate impacts. through fiscal  ,  we reduced emissions by  % across our  entire value chain compared to the    baseline. within our owned operations,  however, we have reduced emissions  (scope   and  ) by  % compared to  last year and  % compared to our    baseline. these reductions were  driven by continued progress in our  commitment to sourcing

strategy focuses on driving transformation  and reducing emissions across our entire value chain. our general mills policy on  climate outlines our approach to mitigation, adaptation, disclosure and advocacy.at general mills, we know that we cannot achieve our ambitious  climate commitments alone. with a majority of our greenhouse  gas (ghg) footprint upstream of our operations, we recognize  the importance of engaging our suppliers on this journey. for  this reason, we joined the supplier leadership on climate  transition program (s-loct), an international community of  over   suppliers and   brands across   countries focused  on training and education to enable greenhouse gas reductions.  through this program, we’re helping suppliers understand and  calculate their greenhouse gas footprint, identify opportunities  to reduce their emissions and prepare to set targets that are  aligned with the science-based targets initiative. s-loct is set  up to be a pre-competitive space, so that the learnings can be  used to drive benefits  not just at general mills,  but across the industry.  learn more about  s-loct.engaging across our value chain suppliers brands customers to support our broader climate goals, general mills brands   are working to incorporate climate-friendly decisions into their  business. nature valley has evolved their traditional commercial  production approach to a custom-created sustainable approach  for each production focused on reducing the amount and/ or the type of equipment typically used. for example, they  employed ‘green the bid’ to conduct a commercial production  in california’s redwood national state park incorporating waste  diversion, e-waste management, elimination of plastic bottles  on set and net emission offsets via forestry projects in panama.  they also consulted  with local park rangers  and a representative  from the national park  foundation to ensure  respectful treatment   of the incredible   shoot location. general mills is partnering with our retailers on the good for  the future program, which creates opportunity to connect  with customers and consumers through shared values. we  partner on retailer events focused on driving incremental  merchandising on brands with a planet-forward action. this  group currently consists of   customers selected due to their  scale as well as commitment to sustainability and combating  climate change. we estimate that together these customers  account for approximately one-third of our customer-related  scope   emissions. we are also partnering with key retailers  to advance  our nature  commitments,  help consumers  navigate in store  and increase the  convenience of  sustainable items. general mills global responsibility     food       planet       people our approach  at general mills, we recognize that  eliminating deforestation and preserving  natural ecosystems are essential to  meeting our climate commitment. to  drive positive outcomes for both people  and planet, we are focused on forest- positive strategies for commodities at  high risk of deforestation and where we  can make a meaningful impact. these  include palm oil, cocoa, cashews and  corn from brazil. as a result of our recent  climate footprinting work, we know  that collectively the production of these  ingredients makes up approximately  %*  of our ingredient-derived ghg emissions,  and most of those emissions come  from land use change. by eliminating  deforestation in these commodities, we  are not only protecting our forests, but  also the people who depend on them. general mills is a founding member of  the consumer goods forum forest  positive coalition of action, formally  launched in september  , which  requires member companies to  collaboratively work toward a forest- positive future, and proactively work with  suppliers to mainstream deforestation- free production across their business.  click here to view more on the  forest positive coalition of action. we recognize that deforestation and  land use change have significant  impacts for climate change. that’s  why we are looking to the work of  sbti, in particular the newly released  forest, land and agriculture (flag)  guidance, as well as where we can  drive impact as we continue to evolve  our strategies and programs.  palm oil: general mills is a relatively  small buyer of palm oil, but we  recognize that our purchasing practices  and cross-sectoral collaboration  toward deforestation-free palm oil  can positively impact ecosystems  and people as well as drive progress  toward our science-based target and  reduce scope   ghg emissions. to help ensure our palm oil purchases  do not contribute to deforestation of  the world’s rainforests or negatively  impact the communities and habitats  that depend on them, we have sourced   % of our palm oil as roundtable  on sustainable palm oil (rspo)  certified sustainable since  . our statement on palm oil sourcing  lays out the principles we expect of  direct suppliers, to ensure that they are  in line with industry best practices, and  contains information on our palm oil  metrics, traceability, supplier mill list,  and grievance process. our approach,  as well as the industry approach, to responsible palm oil is continually  evolving, and we are committed to  working with our suppliers, peers and  partners to support the development  of a forest-positive, people-positive and  climate-positive palm oil supply chain. general mills is actively engaging its  suppliers in direct review of their palm  oil production and sourcing practices,  traceability to mill, and evolving where  possible to traceability to production.  we work closely with our suppliers  and industry partners, like proforest, to  build sustainability performance and  compliance with our commitments  through active score carding,  conversations and collaboration. as  part of our effort to advance progress,  general mills uses the no-deforestation,  no-peat and no-exploitation  implementation reporting framework  (ndpe irf) — a reporting tool designed  to help companies understand and  track progress in

responsibility     food       planet       people as a global food company, our  business is rooted in agriculture.  over time, the quality and availability  of the earth’s natural resources  have declined, while the need to  provide for a growing population  has increased. simply sustaining  the current state of ecosystems  and communities is not enough. we  must instead invest in the potential  of agriculture to ensure a thriving  future for both people and planet.  we believe the most promising solution  to reach our climate goals and create positive planetary outcomes is through  regenerative agriculture, which we define  as a holistic, principles-based approach  to farming and ranching that seeks to  strengthen ecosystems and community  resilience. regenerative agriculture  can help address climate change by  pulling carbon from the atmosphere  and sequestering it in the soil, improving  soil health and driving other benefits,  such as improving nutrient cycling, so  less synthetic fertilizer is needed. these  elements of regenerative agriculture help  to contribute emission reductions toward  our climate goals. this is important because today, the food system accounts  for one-third of all ghg emissions,  with around  % from agriculture and  conversion of natural lands to farmland.  we use an outcomes-based approach,  as opposed to one based on practices,  believing that regenerative systems  are unique to each farm context  and seek to deliver measurable  improvements in soil health and carbon  sequestration, biodiversity, water quality  and quantity, and farmer economic  resilience (see graphic below).  regenerative agriculture soil health  soil is a complex living ecosystem  that is critical for producing food, supporting biodiversity  and

management. our approach  general mills was one of the first  companies that committed to accelerate  this farmer-led movement. two key  objectives of our program are:  n   accelerating adoption of  regenerative agriculture principles  by partnering with farmers within  and outside of our supply chain.n   advancing environmental and  economic outcome science  and technology to demonstrate  how outcomes improve as  farmers implement regenerative  agriculture systems. our focus is on accelerating momentum  in key regions or “supply sheds” rather  than regenerating only our specific  supply chain purchase. we believe  benefits will accrue to our business over  time if we drive impact at a landscape  level. this supply shed approach also  supports broader systems change, so that not only general mills, but  the entire industry, can benefit. we believe regenerative agriculture  programs are most successful when  the approach is holistic and adaptive  rather than prescriptive. this allows our  technical assistance partners to work  with farmers wherever they are on  their regenerative agriculture journey.  for some, this means taking the first  step, whereas others may need help  determining how to layer multiple  techniques as part of a system or expand  proven approaches to additional acres. at general mills, we primarily take a supply shed approach to our regenerative agriculture efforts.  considering the broader system ensures that we’re standing for people and planet, not just   for our company. n   individual company supply chains (suppliers,  grain companies, farmers) often change. n   supply shed investing goes beyond  the supply chain, with a focus on  the broader growing region. n   supply sheds are shared with other  agricultural stakeholders and can  invite co-investment from others.n   supply sheds bring focus to all  growers in that region, enabling a more  inclusive and holistic approach. n   regional supply shed investment can  better align to

farmer adoption  using our scale to maximize our impact,  we are working with farmers to advance  regenerative agriculture in key regions  (see map) where we source our most  greenhouse gas intensive ingredients,  such as wheat, oats and dairy.  pilot programs to advance adoption of regenerative  agriculture, we have partnered with soil  health academy and understanding ag  to activate pilots in priority ingredient  sourcing regions. our first pilots, which  we began in  , set out to test  whether deep training,  :  coaching,  peer-to-peer learning networks and  research of regenerative impacts  would be an effective way to advance  implementation of regenerative systems. we learned quickly that when farmers  see their land as a living ecosystem,  they can begin to identify and address  the root causes and not just the  symptoms of an unhealthy ecosystem. preliminary feedback from farmers  suggests our pilot investments have been  effective in driving change, and we’re  now exploring how layering financial  assistance mechanisms can further  accelerate momentum. as we evolve  and expand our programs, we look  forward to sharing additional insights  and a broader suite of environmental and  economic impacts in the coming year.  expanding impact through partnerships we believe one of the biggest  barriers to widespread regenerative  agriculture adoption is the shortage of  experienced conservation professionals to help farmers implement regenerative  agricultural systems. that’s why we are  collaborating with leading conservation  organizations within key supply  sheds that — in coordination with the  advisors providing farmer support  in our pilots — help to drive further  progress in advancing regenerative  agriculture systems. these include: n   partnership with the national fish  and wildlife foundation (nfwf)  in the great lakes basin and the  northern and southern great  plains to hire field conservation  professionals who support farmers  in areas that are important for  fish and wildlife. learn more. n   soil health programs with the wilkin  county, walsh county, and kittson  county soil & water conservation districts in the northern plains,

understanding of ecosystem function and how  to apply the regenerative principles is critical to  success, but education and qualified agronomic  support is lacking. financial incentives in the absence of  understanding are ineffective. producers learn best from their peers, and a  supportive social network is critical for staying   on the regenerative path. structural barriers inhibit broad participation. local partners who understand context and can  facilitate engagement are the most effective. majority of industry programming is only engaging  the leading segment of producers. typical research approaches based on highly  controlled small-plot research is not sufficient   for understanding real-world farmer outcomes. segregated supply chain/product activations   are costly and complicated. we need to better integrate farmer and community  outcomes as our initial conceptualization of  regenerative agriculture has overemphasized  ecological outcomes.northern plains grains,

natural and organic food  producer in the us, general mills has been  a longtime supporter of organic farming  and remains committed to advancing our  work in this area. organic and regenerative  farming share many underlying principles,  like focusing on soil health and biodiversity,  and working with nature rather than  against it. we’re partnering with external  organizations and organic farmers within  our supply chain to advance organic  agriculture with regenerative techniques. we  believe that with organic and regenerative  management, farms can be part of the solution to environmental degradation by  mitigating agriculture’s negative impacts  while also increasing farmers’ resilience  as they face a changing climate.regenerative and organic agriculture v in september  , general mills  donated the cascadian farm home  farm in skagit valley, washington,  to our partner, the rodale institute,  a pioneer in organic agriculture  and research. while general mills  will continue to own and market  the cascadian farm brand, the  donation of the home farm to rodale  institute will help advance the  regenerative organic movement. v we know that our consumers  care about where and how  the ingredients in their  food are grown. we work  to advance regenerative  agriculture by developing  products with ingredients  using regenerative principles,  such as our annie’s mac n  cheese, with crops grown  using extended crop rotations and  integrated crop-livestock management.  general mills global responsibility     food       planet       people advancing measurement  and technology measuring regenerative agriculture  outcomes today is a significant  undertaking, requiring time, manual field  sampling, and expensive data analysis. to  address this challenge, we have provided  thought-leadership and investment  in research to enable better impact  quantification scientific protocols and  complimentary technology platforms.  we are leading the industry in developing  robust scientific methodologies to  monitor and study the outcomes  associated with regenerative agriculture in  order to ensure credibility of our efforts. in partnership with numerous scientific  organizations, we are conducting in-depth  research on the impacts of regenerative  management on soil health and carbon  sequestration, water quality and  conservation, insect and bird biodiversity,  and farm economics. in addition to this  farm-level research, we are implementing technologies that will allow us to quantify  environmental impacts across entire  regions where we source key ingredients. using satellite imagery, we have begun  to track changes in agriculture practices  such as cover crops and reduced/no-till,  as well as regenerative principles like  length of time with a living root in the soil,  on the landscape over time and model  the resulting impacts on metrics like  greenhouse gas emissions. we are also  developing more scalable approaches  to monitoring biodiversity across farms,  utilizing microphones for recording  birds and light sensors to detect insects,  and are investing in research to enable  further build out of impact metrics  related to dairy, water and resiliency. looking ahead we are excited about our expanded  partnerships with esmc, nfwf and  regrow agriculture to advance adoption  and understanding of regenerative  agriculture principles and the related positive outcomes for people and  planet. we continue to evolve our  program and methodologies with new  learnings, science and technology  and look forward to sharing our  insights with the broader industry. we also plan to bring continued leadership  in support of collective frameworks to  drive greater impact and overall systems  transformation.  no one organization  can deliver scaled impact; so, consistent  with our approaches with alus and  nfwf, we will shift more of agriculture  investment to programmatic approaches  that nest within landscape conservation  priorities and facilitate co-investment  from multiple organizations.  with this in  mind, we’ve been exploring partnerships  with suppliers, peers and customers  and hope to solidify more collaborative  approaches and models in the near future.   lastly, we plan to expand programming in  key supply sheds, launch programs in new  supply sheds, and continue advancing measurement science and technology  to enable ecosystem services markets  and more robust impact tracking.  general mills and regrow agriculture are  partnering to monitor and track regenerative  agriculture and its outcomes at scale,  benefiting general mills as well as the broader  industry. the regrow project spans   million  acres of farmland in north america, europe,  and south america. this acreage represents  our estimated supply sheds – the regions where  we source key ingredients like wheat, oat, and  dairy (within the total acreage being monitored,  we source from roughly   million acres of  farmland each year). as part of this partnership,   general mills will leverage regrow’s  software platform, sustainability insights,  and its technology and data capabilities:  n   operational tillage information system  (optis) is a remote sensing technology that  uses satellite imagery to monitor and verify regenerative agriculture techniques, such as  tillage reduction and cover-crop adoption.  n   denitrification-decomposition  (dndc) models microbial processes  in the soil to estimate changes in net  greenhouse gas emissions, delivering  a more accurate emissions baseline.  regrow’s dynamic monitoring and modeled  outputs will integrate with general mills’ existing  regenerative agriculture and climate tracking  systems. the collaboration with regrow will  enable us to update key ingredient emission  factors and deliver a more accurate emissions  baseline. emission factors will be updated  annually and will incorporate estimated  changes in soil carbon due to changes in  farm management techniques and land use. measuring regenerative agriculture outcomesdesign principles as we look ahead, we will continue to   incorporate these principles as we design

power, support  commerce and nurture ecosystems. on  average, agriculture accounts for  % of  global freshwater withdrawals,* and the  food sector faces increasing risks related  to water quality and availability due to  the impact of climate change on global  and local water cycles and increasing  human demands. this underscores  the leadership role general mills and  other food companies must take to  address water stewardship issues. at general mills, we focus on water use  from watershed to production; identify  opportunities to increase efficiency, conservation, and regeneration (or  recharge); and continually work to  improve performance and enhance  resilience. our vision is a healthy water  cycle with clean, abundant water  accessible to watershed stakeholders  and ecosystems. the general mills water  policy provides a framework for improving  the health of watersheds that are critical  to our business, and we are signatories to  the united nations ceo water mandate. our goal in  , general mills developed specific  goals to reduce our water usage rate in  our owned manufacturing facilities. as we  started to look at water more holistically,  understanding that the majority of our water impact is upstream of our direct  operations. we subsequently committed  to advancing water stewardship plans for  the most material and at-risk watersheds  in our global value chain. over the past  few years, through research and farmer  pilots, we have also been exploring  regenerative agriculture as a means to  improve water quality and quantity. through this evolution of our journey,  we have learned a lot about water  impacts and water risks, what has  worked well and where our approach  may have been limited. on the positive  side, our approach has been holistic and  collaborative, acknowledging the need  for all stakeholders to work together.  on the other hand, given the sheer size  of watersheds, we have had challenges  in influencing and enforcing water  stewardship plans. moreover, we learned that having a plan doesn’t necessarily  guarantee a healthy watershed or that our  company’s water risk will be mitigated.  in fiscal  , we updated our water  commitment to reflect that, as a  food company, general mills will  always depend on clean, abundant  water to grow our ingredients  and manufacture our products: to  champion the regeneration of water  resources in priority watersheds. water stewardship *source: https:/ /www.oecd.org/water/water-use-in-agriculture.htmto champion the  regeneration of water  resources in priority

 impacts and outcomes. we intend to  share more about this direction with  our stakeholders in the coming year. our actions water stewardship is an integral part  of our effort to continually reduce the  environmental impact of our operations,  including the impact that occurs upstream  of our own facilities. we work in numerous  ways to mitigate and adapt to water risk: fund and participate in local water  stewardship activities and policy  advocacy with ngo partners: for  example, in the great lakes region, we are collaborating with the national fish  and wildlife foundation (nfwf) on  the sustain our great lakes program,  a public–private partnership designed  to sustain, restore and protect fish,  wildlife and habitat in the basin by  leveraging funding, building conservation  capacity, and focusing partners and  resources toward key ecological  issues. as one of six funding areas,  regenerative agriculture, especially in  dairy, is advancing our shared vision of  a healthy great lakes watershed, and  this partnership is an important way  we can contribute to positive impact  on water, soil health and farmers in the  region. in  , this program funded  five regenerative agriculture technical  assistance and implementation projects  in the lake michigan watershed.     maximize water efficiency in owned  plants in priority watersheds: we  regularly measure and monitor water  use in our manufacturing facilities  in order to proactively manage our  water footprint. rather than having an  enterprise-wide goal, our plants employ  a site-specific continuous improvement and holistic evaluation approach to  water conservation opportunities.  for example, to help support a  healthy watershed, our albuquerque  manufacturing facility is certified by  the alliance for water stewardship, our  first plant to do so, and has a context- based plan in place. parts of the plan  address internal water use (like having  a rain capture system for watering  their outdoor space) and collaborating  with the nature conservancy to  support indigenous-led projects on  regenerative reforestation and drinking  water access for the local community.  advance regenerative agriculture:   for example, almonds are a featured  ingredient in many of general mills’  products, such as cereal and granola  bars. california is facing extreme  water stress, which is leading to  ground and surface water depletion  as well as negative impacts to  agricultural quality. and almonds, with  their high water dependency, have  the biggest water footprint of any  california crop. preliminary research  suggests that growing almonds with regenerative agriculture principles  results in powerful soil health and  water benefits, including significantly  higher water infiltration rates as well  as potential reductions in irrigation. general mills is taking a multipronged  approach to advance understanding  and adoption of regenerative  agricultural practices for almonds: n   supporting sustainable water  regulation implementation and  agricultural water efficiency. water risk is one of the key ways that  climate change impacts general mills,  in both the sourcing of ingredients  as well as in our manufacturing  operations. this has become even  more clear in recent years, with  acute events that have had a  very real impact on our business.  we have seen that watershed  context can determine how water  risk manifests. for example:water, soil health and climate  are connected in a virtuous cycle  and can be improved by the  same regenerative agriculture  principles. for example, water is  necessary for growing plants and  healthy microbes, which is how  healthy soil sequesters carbon.  and healthy soil makes farms  more resilient to water stress  such as drought and flood.too much water: the    flood and freeze  in the red river valley  caused a significant sugar  beet crop failure.too little water: the    severe drought across the  u.s. and canada complicated  oat sourcing for many  of our key products.climate, water and regenerative agriculturein  , we joined the science- based target for freshwater pilot  to continue gaining insights into  how to advance our commitment to  regenerate water resources in the  watersheds we depend on. this pilot  affirmed our focus on agriculture and  ingredients as the primary area where  we can drive positive impact in water.  it also reinforced that regenerative  agriculture is an important lever  to advance positive outcomes in  some of our biggest supply sheds.  participating in the pilot also revealed  many challenges, for example, with  accessing stakeholders in a timely  fashion and calculating water impact  in a data-poor environment. however,  we learned about exciting new  tools, such as satellite mapping of  groundwater, that supported us in  the illustrative target setting process. we are using sbtn’s assess and  prioritize steps, in collaboration  with the world wildlife fund

strategies  it is critical that we meet this ambition  through strategies that best fit our  product portfolio while maintaining  the safety, nutrition and quality of our  products. given the many different  types of packaging in our products,  innovation in this space requires  significant time, investment and  collaboration. we take a multipronged  approach to packaging, including: n   reduce, reuse and recycle: we  consistently seek opportunities  to improve the recyclability and  reusability of our packaging, and  reduce or eliminate materials. for  example, we have worked for many  years to reduce primary and secondary  film through lightweighting and  removal. to continue to drive progress,  our business teams are encouraged  to design new product packaging to  be recyclable whenever possible, and  we aim to reduce our overall use of  plastic packaging (see our approach  to plastic packaging below).   n   innovation: we’re continuing to  innovate our packaging and to roll out  these innovations at a pace and scale that enables us to maintain the safety  and quality of our products (see p.  ). n   education: we’ve invested in  education around recyclability,  including providing how recycle  labels on more than two-thirds of  our products across our entire u.s.  portfolio, launching a national ad  campaign to educate consumers  about recyclability of our

guidelines and support our  environmental objectives, including: n   a recently completed upgrade to the  biogas generator at our yoplait plant in  murfreesboro, tennessee, is generating   % more renewable power from our  on-site wastewater treatment. this is a  great example of our plant engineering  team leveraging green technology to  harvest energy from our waste stream. n   our maverick creek wind energy  partnership in the texas hill country  recently completed its first full year  of operation. the combination of  wind energy offtake from maverick  creek and cactus flats, our earlier  wind-energy investment, now  exceeds the amount of power  that we purchase across all our  u.s. supply chain locations. n   internationally, we currently have  two solar projects underway, one  in san adrian, spain, and the other  in sanhe, china. we have installed  thousands of solar panels at  each location, helping us cut coal  usage, reduce co   emissions, and  generate positive cost savings.  additional data on renewable electricity  can be found in the appendix. waste reduction: one of the ways  we can reduce our impact on the  environment is by eliminating the  waste we

transportation providers and customers to reduce the environmental impact  of shipping our products around the  world. we continuously work to shift  to more efficient transport modes and  implement improvements in truck fuel  efficiency. our strategies include: n   optimizing transportation modes  across intra-company and  customer freight, including moving  loads to modes with less impact,  such as from truck to rail. n   using innovative technologies  such as lightweight truck cabs. n   collaborating with suppliers and cus - tomers to increase capacity utilization  and providing customers incentives  to use our direct plant ship program. n   prioritizing shippers with strong  environmental credentials. in north  america, approximately  % percent  of our transportation spend is with  smartway certified carriers. n   removing miles from the network  by improving logistics planning, regionally sourcing products,  filling trucks more completely and  using load optimization software  to reduce storage and handling. n   optimizing our customer service  facility and inventory footprint to  decrease outside storage, which  requires additional handling. n   working with

going to animal feed or inedible byproducts. a multifaceted approach to rescue food we closely monitor and manage our  production processes to keep surplus food  out of the waste stream. surplus food from  our operations is first offered to food bank  partners to feed hungry people; the   remainder is repurposed for animal feed   or anaerobic digestion. we actively participate in industry, nonprofit  and government groups focused on food  loss and waste reduction as well as surplus  food recovery, including ameripen, the food  waste reduction alliance, the consumer  brands association, refed, mbold, and the  u.s. food waste and loss   champions.general mills is committed to increasing  surplus food recovery, especially among  consumer-facing food businesses —  grocery stores,

approach at general mills, we are responsible for  maintaining high standards not only in  our own operations, but also across our  value chain. our supplier base is large,  complex and global, with thousands  of suppliers in more than   countries.  through our global responsible sourcing  program, we uphold our supplier code  of conduct and drive ongoing supplier  progress in the areas of health and  safety, human rights, business integrity  and the environment. this increases  our influence to protect and respect  the people who supply, transform and  manufacture the goods and services  we use to make our products. we  were an early adopter of creating a  formal responsible sourcing program  and have continued to strengthen our  program and policies each year.  governance and integration: the  global responsible sourcing program  has a dedicated team of managers  and is part of our global sourcing  operations and capabilities (gsoc) group. gsoc reports to the chief  procurement officer, who leads  global sourcing, with accountability  to our chief supply chain officer.  our program is focused on integrating  key capabilities into sourcing processes  for general mills globally. responsible  sourcing is integrated into our source  to pay process, the workflow utilized  by the global sourcing organization. collaboration: general mills participates  in many forums and partnerships,  both within and outside our industry,  to stay on top of best practices, learn  about new capabilities, and ensure our  responsible sourcing program is strong  and up to date. we are members of  several leading organizations, including: n   sedex: sedex is one of the world’s  leading ethical trade membership  organizations, collaborating with  businesses to improve working  conditions in global supply chains. n   aim-progress: general mills is part  of the aim-progress forum of  leading fast-moving consumer goods  (fmcg) manufacturers and common  suppliers, assembled to enable and  promote responsible sourcing practices  and sustainable supply chains.  audits: we expect all suppliers to uphold  our supplier code of conduct, and we  use responsible sourcing audits to assess  and understand business practices in  our own operations, our co-packers’,  and our suppliers’.* these audits, which  follow the sedex members ethical trade audit (smeta) protocol, are distinct  from food safety audits. the smeta  framework is widely recognized by  companies across many sectors, which  enables suppliers to share audit results  with multiple customers to improve  efficiency and reduce audit burden. accredited third-party auditors perform  these audits and ensure timely creation  of corrective action plans and closure  of identified noncompliances within a  specified time frame. while in prior years  our audit program was divided between  our own operations and our suppliers,  we are now under one comprehensive  integrated program to ensure consistency  in approach and to uphold the highest  standards in all parts of our supply chain.  % of our suppliers in scope are  audited as part of our responsible  sourcing program. we audit about a  third of them each year, and compliant  audits are good for   years. the results  from the audits conducted in fiscal    are shown on the next page.responsible sourcing   human rights

updated our supplier code of  conduct to outline explicit responsible  sourcing expectations for suppliers, so  that they clearly understand all four  pillars of our responsible sourcing  program and the obligations of  acceptance prior to onboarding . n   the updated code includes expanded  protections for human rights with  requirements across nine key areas:  forced labor, child labor, freedom  of association and collective  bargaining, anti-discrimination and  fair treatment, wages and benefits,  work hours and overtime, labor  agencies and recruitment fees,  freedom of movement, and land  rights (see human rights section). n   we revamped our training program  with deeper and more engaging  content, focused on expanded  knowledge of our responsible  sourcing program, outlining  and understanding supplier  expectations, identifying risks  and addressing concerns. n   we now have annual mandatory  supplier code of conduct training  for our entire sourcing organization,  including a knowledge retention  quiz. training is also expanded  to other internal teams, including  our global impact and innovation,  technology & quality teams. additionally, we launched this  training to our external suppliers.integrated program management n   in fiscal  , we expanded our  relationship with integrated program  manager, intertek, to strengthen our  processes and global capabilities  n   we added integrated audit program  managers in global locations — including  in china and portugal — to provide  more direct engagement with suppliers n   we created materials in local  languages (spanish, portuguese  and chinese) to ensure greater  understanding and compliance  with our global supplier base. risk escalation process in   we fully implemented our  new risk escalation and resolution  process (piloted in late fiscal  ) that  incorporates global responsible sourcing  program significant incidents, including  salient issues, and also investigates  human rights concerns outside of audit  data (learn more in our human rights   section) across the supply base. the escalation process ensures  that corrective action plans for noncompliances are resolved in  partnership with our suppliers, with  final sign-off occurring at senior levels,  and when applicable, in conjunction  with our business partners.   looking ahead  building on the enhancements to our  responsible sourcing program over  the last two years, we plan to pilot  expansions of our responsible sourcing  program to indirect and tier  + suppliers  over the next year. we look forward  to communicating more about this  progress in future year reporting.fiscal   audit results sites audited in    countriesaudits with  no findingsaudits with  significant  incidents*      *significant incidents require

valley, we use some animal-  derived products and have long worked  to support the humane treatment of  animals in agriculture. this helps to  ensure a resilient supply chain and aligns  with our ambition to stand for good. at general mills we do not raise or handle  livestock, but we are committed to pro - tecting animals and work closely with our  suppliers to do so. we regularly engage  with stakeholders focused on animal  health and welfare and leverage industry  initiatives that advance livestock produc - tion. our animal welfare policy outlines  our approach throughout the global sup - ply chain for our food products, including: cows: general mills encourages all  suppliers in our dairy supply chain  to support industry-wide efforts that  promote the humane treatment of  cattle. all of the fluid milk we source in  the u.s. for yoplait comes from co- ops whose member farms operate in  accordance with the standards of the  national milk producers federation  animal care program (farmers assuring  responsible management). the  program comprehensively addresses  dairy cow care, including standards for  proper pain relief and disbudding, and  prohibits the routine use of tail docking.  the farm standards are revised on a  three-year cycle starting with a review  by a technical committee composed of  veterinarians and animal care experts.eggs: eggs are an important ingredient in  ice cream, baked goods and doughs, and  we strive to ensure the hens laying them  are treated humanely. our commitment  is to purchase  % cage-free or free- range eggs for our operations globally  by  . in calendar year  , we  contracted  % of global egg purchases  to be cage-free or free-range. avian flu  impacted our suppliers’ abilities to deliver  contracted volumes of cage-free eggs;  our business mix also impacted egg  volumes. our commitment and future  glide path are unchanged, and our glide  path is supported by individual material  conversion plans and timelines, and some  contracts are already in place for  .   our progress is dependent on our  suppliers’ ability to source cage-free or  free-range eggs; ongoing challenges  in supply and  availability could  impact these  numbers. chickens: general mills will work to  transition  % of the broiler chickens  we buy in the u.s. to meet a higher  standard of animal welfare by  .  also by that year, we will work to  ensure broiler chickens are processed  using multistep controlled atmosphere  stunning. by  , we will only use  breeds accepted by the global animal  partnership (g.a.p.) or the royal society  for the prevention of cruelty to animals.  suppliers will be asked to demonstrate compliance through certification or  third-party auditing. as qualifying breeds  have only recently been determined  by g.a.p., we anticipate that supply  will remain limited in the near future. changes that are as broad and  complicated as these require time,  investment and partnership to succeed.  we look forward to working with our  suppliers, consumers, animal welfare  experts and other stakeholders to  drive sustainable, cost-effective  progress. we have engaged current and  prospective suppliers to assess their  ability to support us in this journey. pigs: general mills supports the  development of pregnant sow  housing alternatives and has been  communicating this support to  suppliers over the years. at the end  of calendar year  ,  % of the  pork cuts we buy in the u.s. came  via supply chains in which pregnant  sows do not experience prolonged use  of gestation crates (over   days per  pregnancy cycle). this exceeded our  goal of  - % for  . we expect  to reach  % by the end of  .    looking ahead  we see potential for regenerative  agriculture to

supply  chain according to the ungps in  combination with our ongoing global  responsible sourcing risk assessments. we have defined our focus as the most  salient issues in our value chain —   those issues where our impact to  people is greatest — by examining  the relative severity and likelihood of each issue. while we seek to  address all potential risks, this salient-  issues lens informs our

we  continue to educate our sourcing  teams and other internal audiences  about human rights topics and our  updated supplier code of conduct, they  apply those insights when conducting  supplier audits. for example, as our  sourcing team was vetting a potential  new co-packer, they identified a non- compliance with one of the human  rights expectations outlined in our  code. this expectation serves to ensure  workers are protected from any risk  of forced labor. after discussing our  expectations with the potential new partner, this organization revised their  employment guidelines to meet code  expectations and to the benefit of  their employees. as of october  ,  more than   of our employees and    of our suppliers have received  training about the expanded human  rights requirements within our  updated supplier code of conduct.  while our global responsible sourcing  program is one of the key ways we  address human rights risks, we also apply  our human rights focus

mechanisms to  allow employees, stakeholders and  other potentially affected individuals  to raise concerns, such as our ethics   line, which allows individuals to remain  anonymous (where allowed by law).  we encourage all leaders to foster  an environment where employees  feel comfortable raising concerns  and will not retaliate — or permit  retaliation — against any employee  for good faith reporting of ethical or  legal concerns about human rights or  cooperating in a company investigation.  learn more about our efforts in  the responsible sourcing portion of  the planet section of this

their growing regions and production  methods. we are conscious of this  impact — such as for cocoa, vanilla,  palm oil, seafood and sugarcane. we  engage with key strategic partners to  help us

zero harm to our employees  and the environment. working safely  and in an environmentally conscious  manner is not simply a matter of  personal accountability or choice. as a  corporation, we relentlessly seek to learn  from our work and improve controls  to prevent and mitigate significant  safety and environmental events.  systems: we communicate safety  information and measure progress  with the following systems: we use a single, standardized  environmental and safety management  system (esms) at general mills owned  supply chain locations and ensure  uniform implementation of standards  globally through functional auditing  and a regional support structure. through our global safety tracking and  environmental management system  (gstems), we track safety data at  all production facilities worldwide,  document necessary actions to reduce  future risks and communicate progress. our progress: general mills has a history  of strong safety performance and culture.  in fiscal  , we implemented new  injury and illness reporting criteria and  metrics to improve our safety culture  and focus more intently on eliminating  incidents and situations with the greatest  potential to significantly harm our people.  the decision to change our reporting  criteria and metrics was informed by current best practices for preventing  serious injuries and fatalities (sif),  including insights from the campbell  institute center of environmental health  and safety excellence and guidance  from the u.s. national safety council’s  (nsc) global occupational safety and  health network. (general mills is an  nsc member.) the new safety metric  criteria at general mills are company- specific and based on the globally  recognized principles of the astm e   international standard for recording  occupational injuries and illnesses. fiscal   was the second year for  our updated safety metrics.* data was  gathered from   tracked locations,    of which are production facilities  and innovation, technology and quality  centers. those   locations were  the focus of our safety improvement  work. safety results from those  locations in fiscal   include: n    .  injury/illness rate compared to  the fiscal    .  baseline. the rate  increase was due to a  % reduction  in work hours in fiscal   and a   % increase in company reportable  injuries/illnesses during the pandemic.  more than  % of these reduced  hours came from operations that had  limited or no associated injuries. n   five sif events globally among our  employees, including four serious  injuries and one fatality. sadly, we  lost one of our employees due to an  accident at one of our production  facilities in iowa, united states.n   zero contractor fatalities globally.  n     locations operated with  zero reportable injuries. in fiscal  , we added to our safety  metrics by establishing a baseline for  company reportable environmental  incidents (ereportables), which  are unplanned releases into the  atmosphere, a body of water, or soil,  requiring regulatory notification.  our fiscal   ereportables  baseline was  . we will continue to  track and report on this metric. we continued reinforcing our  safety programs in fiscal  : n   standards – we continued to  operationalize our first-ever standard  focused specifically on sif prevention.  n   measurement – we leveraged our  fiscal   safety metrics change and  improved our capability to identify  and reduce sif potential globally. (we  identified and took action to address  over  ,  potential sif incidents in  fiscal  .) we also deployed new  company environmental metrics  and began data capture related to  significant environmental incidents.  n   mitigation – we prioritized more  than us$  million of capital toward  improving controls related to our  critical safety and environmental risks.  n   learning and culture – we launched  safety leadership  . , our next  safety culture offering, which is  based on principles of human  and organizational performance,  at eight locations globally. leadership and responsibility: n   our global safety governance board,  composed of regional operating vice  presidents, oversees safety leadership,  structure, processes and actions. n   senior-level responsibility for workplace  safety lies with the director of global  safety and environment, who reports  to the chief supply chain officer. n   our corporate safety council is  led by our chairman and chief  executive officer, who is responsible  for general mills policy and safety  culture. the council, which includes  key members of the company’s  executive leadership team, reviews  safety progress and key initiatives.  the council’s focus is on growing  safety culture in both manufacturing  and nonmanufacturing locations. at general mills, we continuously  innovate to improve workplace safety and  environmental protection. our leaders  strive to create a psychologically safe  environment for open conversations  about safety and the environment  where learning is the primary outcome.  through this collaborative approach,  we gain a better understanding of  how work is done and what additional  controls are needed to keep our  people and the environment safe. workplace safety *global

footprint each fiscal year, following the  guidelines of the ghg protocol corporate accounting and reporting standard. this footprint covers  our complete value chain. for our   science-based target, we define our emissions boundaries in  alignment with the science-based target initiative (sbti): scope  : direct greenhouse (ghg) emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by  an organization (e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles). general  mills uses operational control to categorize those emissions within its organizational boundary. scope  : indirect ghg emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat or cooling.  general mills uses operational control to categorize those emissions within its organizational boundary.  general mills uses the market-based methodology for calculation of our scope   emissions, which  considers any contractual instruments that may be used in competitive energy markets, such as green  tariffs, renewable certificates, or ppas. scope  : indirect ghg emissions occurring from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting  organization, but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain. scope   emissions include  all sources not within an organization’s scope   and   boundary, as outlined by the ghg protocol.  general mills uses operational control to categorize those emissions within its organizational boundary.  consistent with sbti guidelines, our targets focus on the categories of ghg emissions that are the  most impactful and actionable for general mills, and exclude emissions such as low-volume ingredients,  capital goods, employee commuting, franchises, downstream warehouse and storage at retail,  consumer trips to store, and end of life (consumer food waste). scope  ,   and   data in the above table were externally verified by apex companies, llc, and our  verification letter can be found on our website . we work to continually update our methodology,  visibility and accuracy, and update results as appropriate each year. it is typical for there to be some  year-over-year variation in footprint hotspots and for baseline footprints to change as a result of  updates. for fiscal  , there were two methodological updates that had a material impact on the  footprint. in shipping, the gallon data was replaced with tonne-kilometer data resulting in an increase  in the shipping portion of the footprint, though with increased confidence in the accuracy. in home  cooking, where the number of product units sold is used to calculate impact, previous data collection  methodology was not accounting for variation in package sizes. for instance, one package may  include   boxes of product, translating to ~
