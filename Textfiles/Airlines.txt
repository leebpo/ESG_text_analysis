 sustainability report      american airlines sustainability report               indexes & data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message about american airlines and this report  american airlines group inc. is a holding company whose primary business   activity is the operation of a major network carrier headquartered in fort  worth, texas, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and  cargo through our mainline operating subsidiary, american airlines, inc.  and our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries, envoy aviation group  inc., psa airlines, inc. and piedmont airlines, inc., as well as contracted  third-party regional carriers. american airlines group inc. and our wholly- owned subsidiaries are hereafter referred to collectively as “american. ”   the term “regional carriers” refers only to those owned by american.american is committed to providing regular and transparent  information about our strategies and performance on the sustainability  issues that we believe are most important to our company and  stakeholders. this sustainability report includes a discussion of  american’s approach to managing those sustainability issues, along  with highlights of our progress and performance in sustainability in   . it covers the activities of american airlines group inc. that are  consolidated for financial reporting, except where specifically indicated  otherwise. unless noted otherwise, the performance data presented in  this report is for the   months ending dec.  ,  .adhering to best practices for disclosure, this report also substantially  aligns with the recommendations of the task force on climate-related  financial disclosures (tcfd)  and the standard for the airline industry  developed by the sustainability accounting standards board (sasb) .   we view both of these reporting frameworks as important indicators   of the sustainability issues that investors and others consider most  significant. regarding forward-looking statements, please see the last   page  of this report . human connection — in our personal lives, at work and within  our communities — is an imperative. the soaring demand for  travel as we emerge from the pandemic is a testament to that  quest for connection, and i’m honored and humbled to be part  of a company that exists to help people fulfill it. over the past year, american has worked tirelessly at putting  our assets to work to fly more and bring people together again.  i’m deeply proud of our team for building back our airline faster  than anyone, flying more people to more places and getting  the world moving again — all while remaining steadfastly  committed to our “why”: caring for people on life’s journey.  succeeding in this aim depends on american continuing to  run a reliable operation and thrive as a profitable enterprise.  but it also demands that we hold ourselves accountable as  exceptional stewards of the resources we are fortunate enough  to have and on which our success depends. our more than   ,  team members are committed to meeting the demand  for air travel and finding ways to do so more sustainably.attracting, retaining and developing the talent we need is  both important to american’s mission and a vital way we  create economic opportunity in our communities. we are  enormously proud of those efforts. indeed, we hired more  than  ,  new team members in  . and more than   ,  positions at american are front-line jobs represented  by unions, jobs that don’t require a four-year degree, yet  provide team members with what we believe are excellent  compensation and benefits and the chance to build stable,  rewarding careers. the shortage of pilots in our industry  has received a lot of attention, but we are equally in need  of talent to fill well-paying jobs across our company — from  maintenance technicians to flight attendants, reservation  agents and technology professionals. to help accomplish those objectives, we are working to  create opportunities and train people from all backgrounds,  including diverse groups historically underrepresented in  the airline industry. that effort includes developing a diverse  pilot applicant pool, including through our cadet academy,  pursuing partnerships with groups such as the aviation  institute of maintenance and the organization for black  aerospace professionals, and recruiting at historically black  colleges and universities. as we have undertaken record  hiring, we’re also seizing the moment to increase awareness,  access and opportunity for everyone interested in exploring  a career in aviation. and we have held ourselves accountable  for our progress by incorporating diversity goals into our  annual executive incentive plan. the outstanding team we’ve built at american is the engine  behind the high level of service we provide to our customers.  even as we rapidly ramped up our operation in  , we  maintained our focus on offering the reliability, dependability  a message   from our ceo ceo robert isom   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message and world-class experience our customers expect. thanks  to the hard work of our team, we recorded our best-ever  customer satisfaction scores — which we measure by  likelihood to recommend — for the year. and we aren’t  content to stop there, as we continually work to find new  and better ways to meet our customers’ needs.  addressing climate change risks also remains a critical  priority for american. whether it’s rising temperatures in  our sun belt hubs or the increasing prevalence of extreme  weather events across our system, this isn’t a distant threat.  it’s affecting our operations today. so, the question isn’t  whether we — as a company, industry, country or society  — need to make real changes, it’s about how quickly and  decisively we will do so. for our part at american, we have set bold and ambitious  climate goals, and are taking real steps to meet them.  over the past several years, we have undertaken the most  extensive fleet renewal effort in the history of our industry  — giving us the youngest mainline fleet among u.s. network  carriers. we became the first airline in the world to receive  validation from the science based targets initiative that   our   emissions reduction target complies with its  rigorous criteria.  we also continue to be a leader in the industry in our use  of sustainable aviation fuel (saf), almost doubling our  saf consumption in   compared to the year before.  alongside our investments in electric vertical takeoff and  landing aircraft, in  , we announced new investments  to catalyze the development of zero-carbon, hydrogen-fuel- cell-powered aviation. and we are developing and deploying  new technologies within our own operations — such as smart  gating — to reduce fuel use and emissions. i’m proud of the role american is playing in helping to  advance low-carbon aviation. and i’m excited about some  of the broader developments we’ve seen, including the saf  blenders tax credit that the u.s. congress included in the  inflation reduction act last year to help grow saf production.  but at the same time, i’m clear-eyed about the fact that  reaching net zero will require more collaboration across the  public and private sectors.  the fact is, american cannot achieve our climate goals  on our own. we can and are working to do our part and  hold ourselves accountable for our progress, but we need  advances in engine, aircraft and fuel technologies to get  there. we also need a policy and funding environment that  will enable these advances to be scaled, with the support of  a modernized and efficient airspace program. climate change, like all aspects of sustainability, is a reminder  that the challenges we face are interconnected. solving them  requires bringing people together and forging connections  across sectors, geographies, communities and ideologies.  that’s why we fly. robert isom   chief executive officer june     american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message indexes & data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message sustainability strategy we have long recognized the importance of environmental,  social and governance issues and have developed an  integrated and transparent approach to related oversight,  management, measurement and reporting. we believe we  have much to show for our efforts, but we continue to look to  best practices within and outside our industry as we refine  and strengthen our policies, practices and disclosures. our priority sustainability issues we periodically conduct sustainability-focused materiality  assessment processes that serve as the foundation of our  analysis of areas of sustainability risk and opportunity. we  conducted our most recent process in early  , which  incorporated a “double-materiality” approach, and affirmed  our priority issues. through ongoing engagement across our  company and with a broad range of external stakeholders,  we annually validate and, as needed, refine our assessment  based on the input we receive and changes in our operating  environment. we also continually monitor trends, standards  and practices relevant to our industry to inform our areas  of focus. additionally, we look to widely adopted external reporting frameworks, including the task force on climate- related financial disclosures and the sustainability accounting  standards board. we view both of these reporting frameworks  as important indicators of the sustainability issues that  investors and others consider most material. these activities have affirmed our focus on the following  priority sustainability issues: • safety • team member engagement, compensation and benefits • diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) • customer satisfaction and operational performance • climate change and fuel efficiency driving progress across all these issues is a key objective for  american. we also recognize that the business landscape is  evolving rapidly and that we must be ready to address new  areas of concern if and when they emerge. over time, we  have worked to develop a more integrated approach to our  management of key risks and opportunities. we will continue  to seek stakeholder input, while also closely monitoring  emerging practices and trends. in  , american airlines was the   only passenger airline named to the   dow jones sustainability north america  index  for the second straight year. we  increased our year-over-year score by  more than  %, which we believe is a  recognition of the progress we have made  toward our sustainability goals.sustainability strategy  as american rapidly ramped up operations in  , our focus on sustainability remained front and center. we  believe prioritizing the safety of our team members and customers, supporting and attracting diverse talent,  providing our customers with a world-class travel experience and positioning american to compete in a low- carbon economy are all integral to running a reliable operation and a profitable company that thrives forever.   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change safety ceo message sustainability  strategy management and governance  since sustainability issues touch nearly every aspect of our  business, their day-to-day management is an integral part  of our operations and functions. american’s vice president,  sustainability, is responsible for guiding and coordinating our  activities at the executive level, and she is supported by a team  of sustainability professionals. she also receives guidance and  feedback from a cross-functional and cross-operational group  of senior leaders with responsibility for regularly assessing the  effectiveness of our sustainability strategy, its implementation  and further integration of sustainability into our company  strategy and operations. (see in conversation: on the front  lines of sustainability at american airlines  on page   .) at the board level, the corporate governance and public  responsibility (cgpr) committee has primary responsibility  for overseeing most of our sustainability efforts, like climate  change. our compensation committee has oversight  responsibility for our human capital issues, including team  member compensation and benefits and engagement, talent  development and dei. our safety committee has primary  responsibility for oversight of american’s safety culture,  program and performance. among its many responsibilities,  our audit committee has oversight of our approach to business  conduct and ethics. our board received updates on each of  these topics at each quarterly board meeting in  , and our  full board reviews union relations, customer satisfaction and  operational performance regularly in its meetings. climate-related governance american takes a coordinated approach to ensuring we have  robust governance of climate-related risks and opportunities.  it begins with board-level oversight and accountability and  extends to our day-to-day operations. at the board level, the cgpr committee has oversight  responsibility for american’s climate change strategy. in  ,  this committee dedicated significant time to reviewing our  climate change risks and opportunities. we also review our  climate change strategy with the cgpr committee several  times throughout the year.  at the management level, we formally assigned responsibility for  oversight of our climate change strategy to our chief executive  officer in  . american’s vice president, sustainability, is  responsible for developing and coordinating the company’s  overall climate strategy and driving its implementation.  responsibility for climate-related issues is also embedded in  senior roles across our company. for example, the operations  team conducts resiliency planning for more frequent and  severe weather events; our fuel procurement team works  to secure cost-effective supplies of sustainable aviation fuel  (saf); and our flight operations and fleet engineering  teams are focused on improving fuel efficiency in the air and  on the ground. our climate change steering committee —  which is led by an executive vice president and includes  representatives from airport operations, flight operations,  technical operations, cargo, finance, safety, people,  communications, legal, government affairs and investor  relations — provides guidance across these efforts.  for more information on american’s corporate  governance policies and procedures, as well as  our standards of business conduct, please see  our website .public policy and political contributions political, legislative and regulatory decisions can have  a significant impact on american’s success, and we  have adopted policies that guide our participation  in these processes. reflecting best practices, our  statement on public policy engagement and political  participation  describes how management and the  board of directors oversee american’s public policy  engagement and the policy considerations that  influence such engagement. our board reviews this  statement regularly and last approved a revision in  january  . we do not use corporate funds to contribute to  candidates, political party committees or political  action committees. on the rare occasion when we use  corporate funds to contribute to a state or local ballot  initiative or a  (c)( ) organization, we have committed  to disclosing that contribution. american did not make  any such political or  (c)( ) contributions in  . the cgpr committee oversees the company’s  major advocacy priorities and activities, political  contributions and principal trade association  memberships. we have committed to aligning our  lobbying efforts with the priorities and goals of the  paris agreement, the international treaty on climate  change.  to help advance our net zero commitment, american  joined the low carbon fuels coalition (lcfc)  in  .  lcfc is a technology-neutral trade association with a  proven track record, which advocates on behalf of clean  fuel standards. (see page   for more information.)   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change safety ceo message sustainability  strategy jill blickstein, american’s vice president, sustainability,  looks back on   and discusses american’s evolving  sustainability strategy. as you look back on the past year, what progress  toward your   net zero goal are you most excited  about? and what has to happen next?  we’re seeing real progress in growing the market for sustainable  aviation fuel (saf). in  , we signed an agreement to buy    million gallons of saf from gevo, a new producer. and congress  enacted the first-ever tax credit aimed at increasing investment in  saf. to ramp up saf production, saf producers will need both  the demand signal and the requisite public policy support. i’m also excited about the progress we’re seeing in hydrogen. in   , american invested in two start-ups working to advance  zero-emissions aviation powered by green hydrogen, both of  which have met major milestones recently. the united states is  investing in green hydrogen, and while it’s far in the future, we  want aviation to be able to take advantage of that growth. that takes me to the second part of your question. we’re  making progress, but we can’t reach net zero on our own.  we need government and private industry working together  to support alternative fuels. i’m not necessarily talking about  direct collaboration, but i do mean everybody working toward  the same goal. in the case of saf, that means producing    billion gallons in   to fuel the entire u.s. airline industry.  fortunately, there has been a lot of good news on that front,   and we expect to see more. how does american’s capital spending align with your  climate strategy? investors have started asking that question as well. i’ll start by  saying that no airline can spend its way to net zero. getting  there is going to require advances in airframe, engine and fuel  technologies, along with a policy environment that enables them  to scale. that said, roughly  % of our total capital expenditure  budget for   went toward projects that yield decarbonization  benefits, even if the efforts themselves also serve other purposes.  that includes about $ .  billion for new, more fuel-efficient aircraft  and initiatives such as electric ground support equipment and  retrofitting existing aircraft with lighter seats. we have also  committed to investing $  million as an anchor partner in  breakthrough energy catalyst . are there other aspects of your sustainability strategy  where you are seeing progress?  there are too many to mention here, but that’s why we produce  an entire report. i am proud, though, of the work we are doing  to diversify the flight deck. our team members are american’s  biggest strength, and i’m glad to be part of a leadership team  that seeks to recruit top talent from all backgrounds. we have  initiatives focused on training the next generation of pilots as well as aircraft maintenance technicians. both are generally  well-paying careers with opportunities for advancement. we  need new minds to help solve today’s challenges, and for a goal  as big as decarbonizing our operation, it’s all hands on deck. after several years of publishing an esg report,  what was behind american’s decision to call this a  sustainability report instead? as we’ve deepened and matured our work across a range of  nonfinancial issues, we’ve come to believe that “sustainability”  better captures our purpose. that’s because it takes into account  both risk management — which is at the core of esg and a critical  priority for american — and our impact on the environment  in which we operate. we recognize that american’s long-term  success is linked inextricably to the health of the planet and the  people we serve. that’s how we define sustainability.  in conversation:   on the front lines  of sustainability   at

achieve net zero greenhouse gas (ghg)  emissions by  . to drive progress toward that goal, we  have set an intermediate target to reduce ghg emissions  intensity by  % by  , relative to a   baseline. this  includes both direct emissions (scope  ) — which are  primarily from the jet fuel used in flight — and the emissions  from the production of the jet fuel the airline uses and the  consumption of jet fuel by contracted regional carriers. in  , we became the first airline globally to receive  validation from the science based targets initiative (sbti)  that  our intermediate   ghg reduction targets comply with  the sbti criteria. american submitted its intermediate targets  under the sbti’s first aviation pathway, published in august   , which was designed to limit warming to well-below  °c  above preindustrial levels, the temperature goal outlined in  the paris agreement.  our strategy for reaching net zero ghg emissions by    is focused on running an ever more fuel-efficient operation,  primarily by operating more fuel-efficient aircraft that are  increasingly powered by low-carbon fuel. in  , we took  meaningful steps forward in these areas — from adding  new-generation aircraft to our fleet and finalizing our most  significant sustainable aviation fuel (saf) offtake agreement to  date, to announcing two investments in companies focused on  the development of low-carbon, hydrogen-powered aviation.  our climate strategy  our strategy to reach net zero emissions is focused on driving  progress across several key levers — some of which we have  the ability to influence directly, and some of which will require  action and collaboration within our industry, across sectors  and by policymakers.  underpinning our strategy is the in-depth analysis we initially  conducted in   to understand the climate-related risks and  opportunities facing our company. in early  , we further  expanded and deepened this analysis by incorporating  . °c  aligned scenarios, consistent with the ambition of the paris  agreement, in our assessment of both physical and transition  risks. this includes the international energy agency’s (iea)  net zero by   (nze) scenario, which we selected because  it includes aviation-specific narrative and milestones. for a  detailed discussion of our process and findings, see page  . our carbon footprint in  * total emissions

data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message working to make zero-carbon, hydrogen   fuel cell-powered flight a reality  decarbonizing aviation will require low- or zero-carbon  fuel sources that can generate the significant power  aircraft engines need — and that can be practically  distributed to, and carried on, the commercial aircraft  that will be coming into service in the next decade. major  challenges remain in making hydrogen available for  commercial aviation, but hydrogen offers the potential to  become a game-changing fuel source. while hydrogen contains nearly three times more energy  per unit of weight than jet fuel, it has less energy per unit  of volume. this low volumetric energy density means that  on board an aircraft, hydrogen would require too much  space and, therefore, would need to be stored as a liquid  to provide sufficient energy for longer-range flights. and  the aviation community — airports, airlines and hydrogen  producers — would need to develop a new supply chain  to produce and deliver hydrogen to aircraft. however,  hydrogen has a safe and successful track record as a  transportation fuel in hydrogen-powered cars and buses.  and it produces only water vapor as a byproduct when  used in a fuel cell, since the fuel has no carbon content to  start with.  american is helping to catalyze the development of  hydrogen-electric propulsion technology — through  which hydrogen is used in fuel cells — as well as the  future of hydrogen distribution logistics. in  , we  announced strategic investments in zeroavia, a pioneer  in hydrogen-electric, zero-emission aviation powerplants,  and universal hydrogen, a company building a green  hydrogen distribution and logistics network for mobility  applications, starting with commercial aviation.zeroavia: hydrogen-electric propulsion for aviation zeroavia’s novel zero-emissions, hydrogen-electric  powertrain replaces traditional engines on existing fixed-wing  aircraft. the powertrains use green hydrogen, which is stored  in tanks and converted to electricity in flight using a fuel cell,  which then powers the electric motors. the green hydrogen  is produced through electrolysis — powered by locally  generated renewable energy — and stored at or near airports. zeroavia is working to retrofit and linefit its powertrains to  existing faa-certified fixed-wing aircraft, which simplifies  regulatory issues and reduces time to market. in early   , zeroavia flew the maiden flight of its  -seat dornier    testbed aircraft, retrofitted with a full-size prototype  hydrogen-electric powertrain on the left wing of the aircraft.  by the early  s, the company has its sights set on flying  aircraft with  –  seats and a range in excess of  ,   nautical miles.universal hydrogen: green hydrogen distribution universal hydrogen is working to build a flexible and scalable  approach to hydrogen logistics by transporting it in modular  capsules over the existing freight network from green  production sites to airports around the world. at the airport,  the modules are loaded directly into the aircraft using existing  cargo-handling equipment. universal hydrogen anticipates entering into revenue service  in  , with plans to expand its services to larger, single-aisle  aircraft — first for auxiliary power and then as a primary fuel  by the mid- s. the company is also developing conversion  kits to retrofit regional airplanes with a hydrogen fuel cell  powertrain to serve as a solid proof point for a new clean- sheet single-aisle aircraft. in early  , universal hydrogen successfully completed a test  flight of a  -passenger, hydrogen-powered regional airliner,  the largest hydrogen fuel cell-powered airplane to take to the  skies and the largest airplane to cruise principally on hydrogen.hydrogen energy is transported to be  stored at or near airports renewable energy is generated

— and associated operations as efficiently as  possible is key to achieving our climate goals. we have a  target to achieve a   million-gallon absolute reduction in  jet fuel use by  , using   aircraft as a baseline, which  will avoid almost  ,  metric tons of co₂e. that means  aircraft in our fleet as of january   that continue to fly  through   will use   million gallons less fuel as a result  of fuel-efficiency initiatives. reducing excess weight is one of the best ways to reduce  ghg emissions because the weight of an aircraft is a critical  driver of how much fuel it uses. we have taken a number  of steps — from installing lighter seats and removing seat- back entertainment systems to using lighter paint — that  collectively save millions of gallons of fuel and associated  emissions each year. in  , we kicked off a significant effort in partnership  with safran landing systems to upgrade our boeing  -   fleet — which includes more than   aircraft currently  in operation — from steel to lighter-weight carbon brakes.  carbon brakes provide up to   pounds of weight savings  per aircraft, reducing fuel use and avoiding   metric tons of  ghg emissions per aircraft per year. we estimate that over a   -year period, this investment will avoid more than  ,   metric tons of co e. we look for opportunities to implement operational changes  that reduce on-the-ground fuel use as well, such as using  just one aircraft engine to taxi to the gate after landing, which we estimate reduces emissions by up to  %. we are  also finding opportunities to transition our ground support  equipment (gse) to run on electric power. by the end of   ,  % of our gse was electric. and, recently, we started  using renewable diesel to fuel our gse at some locations. optimizing how we assign gates to reduce taxi time is  another way to reduce fuel use, and in  , we began  implementing “smart gating” technology developed by  american. the new technology uses real-time data from a  wide variety of sources to reduce gate conflicts, taxi time  and airport congestion. in the process, it reduces fuel use  and associated ghg emissions. we used this technology  at dallas fort worth international airport (dfw), charlotte  douglas international airport (clt) and miami international  airport (mia) in  . smart gating is projected to save over   .  million gallons of fuel per year at these three locations  alone, while reducing co₂ emissions by more than  ,   metric tons annually. in the first half of  , we expanded  smart gating to ronald reagan washington national airport  and chicago o’hare international airport. focusing on flying as efficiently as possible, including  considering everything from the speed and paths our aircraft  take on departure and descent to how flight crews adjust en  route to account for changing weather conditions, is another  way we save fuel and reduce ghg emissions. we are also  working to understand how we can efficiently adjust flight  paths to avoid contrails, which may contribute to aviation’s  impact on climate change. (see advancing scalable  solutions to avoid contrails at right.)advancing scalable solutions to   avoid contrails there’s an emerging scientific consensus that the net  impact of contrails — the condensation trails of ice  clouds that can form when a plane’s hot, humid exhaust  mixes with cool, humid air high in the atmosphere —  from aviation may have a warming impact as great or  greater than the warming caused by the co  emitted by  aviation’s use of petroleum jet fuel. persistent contrails  formed during the late afternoon and evening may have  a particularly large warming effect.  american is helping lead the way toward developing  scalable, cost-effective solutions to contrails avoidance.  in  , we joined the contrails impact task force, a  cross-sectoral initiative that brings together aviation  industry, academic, technology and nonprofit partners  to tackle the climate challenge of contrails. convened  by rmi, a nonprofit environmental organization, and  breakthrough energy, the goal of the task force is to  share and expand on the latest science on the climate  impact of contrails, develop actionable strategies to  avoid warming contrails, analyze the operational and  financial challenges of implementing potential solutions,  and establish a roadmap for implementation and  validation of contrail mitigation tools.   american airlines

made in collaboration with the u.s.  federal aviation administration (faa), which oversees our  nation’s airspace system. one example of how we help to  drive these improvements is our partnership with the faa  and nasa on nasa’s airspace technology demonstration    (atd- ). american worked closely with nasa on the trial  program in charlotte, north carolina, which was designed to  test and validate the benefits of terminal flight data manager  infrastructure, including how it can save fuel, reduce carbon  emissions and increase information-sharing between the faa  and industry. during the four-year demonstration project at  clt, atd-  saved more than  .  million gallons of fuel and  ,   tons of co .   the project was awarded the   sustainability maverick  award presented by world atm congress. the faa is in the  process of implementing the program in around   airports,  and it projects that the annual co  savings will equal  ,   tons when the project is fully implemented.    https://www.worldatmcongress.org/maverick-awards  modernizing our airspace system modernizing the country’s network of aviation infrastructure,  technology and services will increase operational efficiency   and reduce jet fuel use. in turn, that will avoid millions of  metric tons of co  emissions annually and help reduce aviation’s  carbon footprint. american is working collaboratively with the  faa — and advocating through the policymaking process —  for resources to accelerate the deployment of measures that  are both cost-effective and will yield immediate and long-term  environmental benefits.  one of these is unlocking automatic dependent surveillance– broadcast in (ads-b in) capability on aircraft that are equipped  to take advantage of this technology. ads-b in leverages  satellite-enabled navigation instead of outdated radar systems  to deliver weather and traffic position information directly to the  flight deck. that allows pilots to optimize flight paths, particularly  in low-visibility conditions, which reduces emissions and enhances safety. currently, the faa requires use of ads-b   out — which works by broadcasting information about an  aircraft’s gps location, altitude, ground speed and other data to  ground stations and other aircraft — but not ads-b in. other recent airspace initiatives include setting new criteria for  commercial space launches and releasing new high-altitude  routes along the eastern seaboard, which aim to reduce airspace  congestion. when airspace is congested, flights often have to  take longer routes, are put into holding patterns or even have to  divert to alternate airports — which can increase fuel use and  emissions significantly. therefore, reducing airspace congestion  can help reduce and avoid emissions. through our membership in the international air transportation  association (iata), the trade association for the world’s airlines, we  also support reforms to the global airspace system that will enable  more efficient flight operations and reduced ghg emissions.we were recognized for our sustainability  efforts as the   eco-airline of the year  by air transport world (atw), a

climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message sustainable aviation fuel aiming to significantly increase our use of saf — which  reduces life cycle ghg emissions by as much as  %  compared to conventional, petroleum-based jet fuel — is a  core part of american’s strategy to achieve net zero ghg  emissions. it is also key to achieving the in-sector reductions  required to meet our science-based target for  . we have set a goal to replace  % of our jet fuel use with saf  by  , avoiding approximately  .  million metric tons of co .  we are taking steps to achieve this by putting into place firm  saf offtake commitments that enable saf producers to raise  the capital necessary to build new production capacity, while  helping provide american with the saf supply we require to  meet our goals. in  , we finalized an agreement to purchase    million gallons of saf from biofuel company gevo, with  deliveries scheduled to commence in  . (see reducing the  carbon intensity of saf  on page  ). by the end of the year,  we had commitments covering more than   million gallons of saf from  – , which will fulfill nearly  % of our    saf goal. to meet these commitments, our development- stage partners will need to be able to develop and operate  commercial-scale facilities. in  , we used more than  .  million gallons of saf on our  flights, almost doubling our saf consumption compared to   . we continue to be a leader in saf consumption as one of  the few airlines to report using more than   million gallons a year. as critical as saf is for achieving our own and our industry’s  climate goals, it is not yet available at the scale or price  needed to reduce aviation’s emissions significantly. scaling  saf production to the point where it can materially reduce  our industry’s emissions and be cost competitive will take the  combined efforts of the private and public sectors. american continues to advocate for governments to deploy  policy tools, including incentives, credits and investments in  research, to create the market conditions needed to make saf an economically viable alternative to conventional jet fuel.  in  , we joined the low carbon fuels coalition (lcfc)  — a technology-neutral trade association that advocates for  scientifically based, marketplace-driven, low-carbon fuel policies  — to help american and the aviation industry as a whole move  closer to reaching net zero. we also voiced support for specific  policies designed to boost saf production and make it more  cost competitive, including the saf blenders tax credit that the  u.s. congress included in the inflation reduction act of  . another way we are helping build the saf market is as an  anchor partner in breakthrough energy catalyst (catalyst),  which is working to accelerate decarbonization efforts by  investing in innovative new technologies, including saf   and green hydrogen. american has committed to investing   $  million in these efforts. in  , catalyst invested   $  million to help lanzajet — a saf producer using novel  alcohol-to-jet technology — build a demonstration plant that  will be critical to scaling production. expanding reporting to include biogenic emissions a key part of our net zero strategy is sourcing fuels from biomass, such as plants, grasses, plant oils  and animal fats. since the biomass was grown by absorbing co  from the atmosphere, the fuels do  not add co  to the atmosphere when combusted. emissions from these biomass-based fuels are  considered biogenic emissions and are reported differently from fossil emissions. the co  portion  of biogenic emissions is reported as its own category that is separate from scope   since, unlike the  combustion of petroleum-based fuels, these emissions are not adding to net atmospheric co  levels.  the remaining ghg emissions, which are ch  and n o, are reported in scope   in co  equivalents.  there are also upstream emissions associated with converting biomass into saf. growing, harvesting  and transporting biomass and processing it into saf all emit ghgs that need to be accounted for  in the life cycle emissions of

climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message reducing the carbon intensity of saf saf has the potential to dramatically reduce life cycle ghg  emissions compared to conventional, petroleum-based jet  fuel. but exactly how much saf reduces emissions depends  on the feedstock, and the technologies and techniques  used to produce it. realizing the positive benefits of saf  depends on whether it is sustainably produced — in ways  that significantly reduce carbon intensity, and also by using  feedstocks and methods that don’t compete with food  production or contribute to deforestation, biodiversity loss   or other adverse impacts. american is prioritizing working with saf suppliers that  integrate sustainability considerations throughout their  processes — from the feedstocks they use to the energy  sources that power their operations. as a result, we have  developed partnerships with a range of innovative saf  producers and sustainability leaders that are pioneering the  development of new saf pathways that could hold the promise  of a net zero — or even net-negative — carbon footprint. for example, we have an agreement to purchase up to    million gallons of carbon-neutral saf produced by  prometheus fuels, which uses a novel process to make net  zero carbon transportation fuels. and we have an agreement  to take delivery of   million gallons of saf annually over   a seven-year period beginning in   from aemetis. it will   be produced at the aemetis carbon zero plant using  renewable hydrogen, renewable hydroelectric electricity   and renewable feedstocks. gevo: a circular economy approach to   producing fuel — and food  gevo is a company that is developing production facilities  to produce liquid hydrocarbons — including saf — from  renewable carbon and energy sources. in  , american  committed to purchasing   million gallons of saf over  five years from gevo, with deliveries expected to start in  .  gevo is a key player in the development and commercialization  of renewable hydrocarbons and chemicals, offering a circular  economy approach to decreasing the use of fossil fuels that  aligns with american’s goals of reducing carbon intensity. one  notable aspect of gevo’s approach is its focus on sustainability  throughout the entire production chain. gevo designed its process to use residual starch  from industrial field corn, which is then converted to  saf using an ethanol-to-jet pathway. gevo prioritizes  sustainability at every step of its process, first by  working with farmers who use regenerative agriculture  and sustainable farming techniques.  gevo’s saf production process will separate the elements  of the corn, using the protein to create high-value nutrition  products and corn oil, and using the starch for saf and  other fuels and chemicals. the production process is  designed to reduce waste and ghg emissions further by  using renewable energy, including electricity from wind  turbines and renewable natural gas, to power its facility.  as part of its circular economy model, gevo actively searches  for opportunities to decarbonize its processes, collaborating  with farmers to explore techniques that improve yield, reduce  emissions, sequester carbon in the soil and increase the  efficiency of every acre. by seeking partnerships to advance  the use of renewable energy, including saf and other renewable fuels, renewable natural gas, green hydrogen, wind  power, solar energy and more, gevo expects to continue to  enhance the sustainability of all its products and processes.  it will also pass the benefit of decreased fossil fuel use on to  its customers, such as american and the approximately    million passengers we carry each year.   american

climate scenario analysis in   that focused on  identifying and assessing the physical and transition climate- related risks and opportunities facing the company over the  short, medium and long term. in   and early  , we  continued to build on this by undertaking a more detailed  analysis of these risks and opportunities. this included adding   . °c scenarios into our assessment, as well as expanding  the number of sites included in the physical risk evaluation,  exploring geographic regions around the world in which we  operate that are projected to experience greater impacts, and  examining more closely the effects of potential changes in  policy, technologies and markets. the insights from this process, conducted in alignment with  the recommendations of the task force on

(see box at right for more information on the climate scenarios  we use for both our transition and physical risk assessments.) the transition scenarios compare different possible versions  of the future and the levers and actions that produce them,  with the aim of stimulating insights about the future of global  energy. we used these scenarios to explore elements of  the organizational resilience of american’s own business  operations as well as the resilience of our value chain, such as  upstream supplier reliability during extreme weather events  and saf production capacity. as part of the scenario analysis,  we also looked at downstream customer behavior changes  and how american’s climate ambitions might capture these  changes and manifest them as opportunities.  the table

organization  is working to protect elephants, rhinos, monkeys and other  endangered species from the illegal wildlife trade that is  pushing them toward extinction. this global criminal enterprise is worth an estimated $  billion   annually, with poachers and traffickers trading in a wide  variety of endangered wildlife and wildlife body parts,  generally for sale as trophies or for purported medicinal  uses. that can include rhino horn, ivory, pangolin scales  and tiger parts. their activities are a major threat to wildlife  conservation, global biodiversity and human health, and  they are linked to money laundering, corruption and extreme  violence, as well as the trafficking of drugs and weapons.  as a signatory of the united for wildlife transport taskforce  buckingham palace declaration, american will devote  resources to disrupting the illegal wildlife trade. among the buckingham palace declaration’s   commitments,  we have pledged to increase awareness among team members  about the nature, scale and consequences of these activities.  american will also improve the training of team members  to help them identify and report suspected illegal wildlife  trade, and we will encourage our airline partners and cargo  customers to do the same. to help enforcement agencies  identify potential shipments of suspected illegal wildlife and  their products, we will also

team members and contractors are also encouraged to ask  questions and report safety hazards, concerns and incidents  without fear of retaliation.  safety governance and management an uncompromising commitment to safety, security and  continuous improvement is a shared responsibility — from  our board of directors to frontline team members. our  chief executive officer retains ultimate responsibility  and authority for safety culture and performance, while  the board’s safety committee has formal oversight  responsibilities for safety. the board receives monthly  updates on key safety performance metrics and multiple  detailed reviews throughout the year.our safety management system our approach to safety is guided by our safety management  system (sms), an organization-wide approach to identifying  and managing risk. american was the first u.s. carrier to  pioneer an sms, in  . it has since been incorporated   into federal aviation administration (faa) regulations for   all carriers.  our sms emphasizes safety management as a fundamental  business process across the enterprise. it involves a full  commitment from the most senior leaders through to each  team member to integrate safety into how we do our jobs.  our sms promotes a culture in which our team members  proactively identify, analyze and manage risks. the sms  ensures robust and repeatable processes with local  ownership, driven by data to reduce risks and continuously  improve and enhance safety. we collaborate closely with  the faa to maintain operational safety at the highest level  possible and actively share best practices with our industry  peers, governments and aerospace manufacturers. the four  components of our sms are noted in the accompanying box.operating safely american

and key performance indicators. part of  our sms foundation, this policy helps to create a culture  that encourages effective management of risk along with  continuous improvement. the safety policy complies with all  applicable regulatory requirements and laws in the countries  where we operate and establishes standards for acceptable  operational behavior. in addition, our safety policy  is actively communicated to all team members and regularly updated to  promote occupational health and safety. our emergency response manual (erm), which establishes  effective and efficient response practices for various types of  emergencies — including natural disasters — is an integral  part of our sms. the erm serves as the governing document  for the american airlines corporate emergency response  plan. it includes guidelines to prepare for and respond to  emergencies, responsibilities for team members, protocols for  communicating with internal and external stakeholders, and  mechanisms to report emergencies. the erm also includes a  detailed pandemic preparedness and response plan that was  instrumental in helping us navigate through every phase of  the covid-

of each day and will continue to  work to provide the safest environment for our team members  and customers by continually improving and enhancing our  approach to safety. the overall goal of team member reporting is to improve safety  awareness and identify operational deficiencies by facilitating  an open line of communication between employees and  management without fear of reprisal. potential safety concerns  and suggestions identified through our many safety reporting  programs are critical to early identification of hazards. these  reports also allow the company to proactively address potential  risks and implement corrective actions to resolve safety and  security issues. when a team member identifies any safety-related concern,  he or she is encouraged to report the issue. once the concern  is received, skilled safety investigators collaborate with  operational partners to review the information provided,  assess the hazard and develop corrective actions to ensure  the issue is addressed. these reports are then reviewed as  part of the broader sms to determine if there are system- related risks developing. we follow up with the reporter to communicate what we learned and what steps we are taking  to prevent similar concerns from arising again. this follow- through and prompt action helps encourage additional  reporting, thus creating a robust safety reporting life cycle. our most prominent safety reporting initiatives include the  following: aviation safety action programs (asaps), ground  safety action programs, flight operations quality assurance,  the international air transport association's (iata's)  operational safety audit, line operations safety audits,   and the learning and improvement team. safety action programs everyone at american has a role to play in ensuring that our  people, customers and assets remain safe. through asaps,  team members can confidentially report potential hazards  and mistakes without concern of fault or fear of punitive  action, thus reinforcing a learning culture and improving our  operations along the way.  american was the first airline to create an asap, and now  such programs are commonplace among airlines worldwide.  currently, we have asaps for our flight, flight service,  dispatch, technical operations, central load planning and  ground (fleet service and cargo) teams, which we believe  gives us significantly greater coverage than the industry  average.  in  , we recorded  ,  asap reports, a  % increase  over  , corresponding with the significant ramp-up in  our operations. our ground asap, which we launched in   , quickly established itself by recording the third-largest  number of reports among our six programs in  . that  represents an  % year-over-year increase. an increase in  asap reports is a welcome trend, providing evidence that our safety program is working as anticipated. team members  are comfortable raising concerns when they see them, which  provides us with more opportunities to resolve them. flight operations quality assurance flight operations quality assurance (foqa) is a voluntary  safety program administered jointly by american and the  allied pilots association (apa) that uses routinely recorded  flight data to proactively identify and correct deficiencies in  flight operations. we routinely monitor all our flights and use  algorithms to look for potential safety risks and trends. the  results allow us to monitor aircraft systems, performance and  operational efficiency and help us to better understand pilot  performance in the operating environment.  to enhance foqa’s effectiveness, american partnered with  collins aerospace in   to retrofit our narrowbody aircraft  with its aircraft interface device (aid). as of february   ,  % of our fleet was equipped with this wireless data  transfer system. we expect that american’s entire fleet will  be outfitted by the end of  . aid improves the speed   with which we can retrieve foqa data, and it represents   an important tool to increase accuracy in monthly reporting,  improving aircraft reliability and preparing for future  products and capabilities.  in  , american also became the first carrier in the united  states to adopt cefa aviation mobile services, a cloud-based  application that allows pilots to recreate their flights on their  company ipad. this tool improves on the concept of crew  post-flight debriefing by providing real-time feedback to our  pilots, turning each flight into a learning opportunity and  ultimately contributing to the safety assurance of our sms.    american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change sustainability  strategy ceo message safety iata's operational safety audit  as part of our commitment to transparency and monitoring,  we are a registered participant in the iata's operational  safety audit (iosa) program, an internationally recognized  evaluation system designed to assess an airline’s operational  management and control systems. an iosa, which takes  place every two years, creates a structured methodology with  standardized checklists that are comparable on a worldwide  basis, enabling and maximizing the joint use of audit reports.  in april  , we successfully completed our iosa in  conformance with all standards and recommended  practices. iata modified its audit methodology this year  to be risk-based. as part of our efforts to be an industry  leader, american volunteered to be the first u.s. carrier to  participate under this new approach. line operations safety audits since launching our continuous pilot line operations safety  audits (losa) program in  , we have been sending  highly trained pilot observers onto the flight deck to better  understand work-as-done versus work-as-imagined.  observing our frontline team members in action and  gathering safety-related data on environmental conditions,  operational complexities and crew performance in real time  provides us with valuable insights for enhancing safety and  resilience. in  , our pilot losa observers conducted    flight deck observations, a  % increase compared with  . american has expanded losa to other workgroups as well.  we implemented a continuous dispatch losa in late    and were able to conduct   observations in  . we have  also been developing a cabin losa program and expect to  begin conducting observations by the middle of  . this  program will help us better understand the challenges facing our flight attendants and the measures we can take to keep  the cabin safe for everyone. we will continue to evaluate the  feasibility of expanding losa to other operational groups,  with  % coverage as our ultimate goal. learning and improvement team we created the learning and improvement team (lit) in    to collect and analyze data — falling under what is  often referred to as a safety   program — on what makes our  pilots successful in their everyday work. lit is composed of  line pilots who are specially trained to conduct flight deck  observations and facilitated discussions. while it is similar  in some ways to losa, lit is a separate program. one  of the key differences between lit and american’s other  flight sms programs (i.e., asap, foqa, losa) is that lit  focuses on what goes well and why, thus providing a new  safety lens through which to view the operation. combining  lit data with other sms data provides american with a  broader picture of the system, rather than looking solely at  unwanted outcomes. in  , we expanded the number of  lit navigators from six to  . they conducted   flight deck  observations and   one-on-one pilot interviews, which we  call “shop talks. ” safety risk management the safety risk management (srm) element of our sms  provides a decision-making process for identifying hazards  and mitigating risk based on a thorough understanding of  our systems and their operating environment. srm enables  us to consider the risks in our operations and reduce them  to an acceptable level. we use the srm process whenever  there is a significant change to our operations, such as  delivery of a new type of aircraft or the addition of a new airport to our network. we also apply srm when our safety  assurance process identifies a new hazard or an ineffective  control of an existing hazard. we use several tools to identify hazards and evaluate the  need for new or revised risk controls. the process of risk  management is the same regardless of the trigger or event,  and our sms looks at multiple factors for risk. while the faa  requirements are geared toward flight safety, our sms goes  further to evaluate a wider range of global risks, including  operational disruptions. peer support for pilots project wingman, established by american and the  apa, provides our pilots and their family members with  a discreet, peer-to-peer  /  helpline for reaching out  to other pilots for emotional and occupational support.  this program is managed by a deputy chair of the apa  aeromedical committee, and american employs a pilot  at the managerial level on a full-time basis to support  and promote it. more than   pilots currently volunteer for project  wingman. in addition to bringing a unique understanding  of the challenges pilots can face in their professional and  personal lives, these volunteers all undergo specialized,  intensive training. as a result, they are well-positioned  to know when to listen and provide encouragement or  recommend other resources when a situation warrants  greater intervention.    american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change sustainability  strategy ceo message safety safety promotion safety culture is the foundation of any sms, with trust at the  core. at american we believe in a just culture approach,  which encourages each team member to take responsibility  and have accountability for achieving the highest safety  standards and results. this approach, which we have  championed for more than a decade and has since become  an accepted aviation industry standard, encourages team  members to report errors, risky decisions or omissions  without fear of punitive actions. we train our teams to look at  potential safety events using three types of behavior: human  errors, at-risk behavior and reckless behavior.  safety training among new safety training initiatives in  , we  successfully launched two classes certified by the american  red cross through our learning hub. the first offered  certification in first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)  and use of an automated external defibrillator (aed). this  eight-hour class certified   members. a four-hour cpr/ aed class certified another  . we expect team member  certifications to increase significantly in  . with the  addition of a red cross-certified “train-the-trainer” option  through our in-house qualified instructor, we will train team  members to teach first aid and cpr/aed on-site across our  key hub locations. our ramp agents have the highest rate of injuries among  all team member groups, primarily as the result of lifting  baggage, often in awkward and tight spaces. working  with pristine condition international, which introduced the  science of olympic weightlifting techniques to industry, we  conduct training programs on proper lifting techniques.  in  , pristine also began training flight attendants and  aircraft maintenance team members, who suffer the second-  and third-highest injury rates, respectively. pristine also  developed and delivered targeted training to groups with  specific areas of opportunity. staysafe and safety engagement tool staysafe is a safety communications campaign implemented  across our airport and technical operations organizations. its  materials focus on lessons learned and ways to prevent team  member injuries and equipment damage. any bulletins or  alerts are available across multiple platforms in order to reach  the greatest number of team members affected. through our safety engagement tool, we are bringing  company leadership to the front lines to engage in  conversations with team members. managers can  communicate safety expectations, assess risks in the  operation and reinforce safe behaviors. for detailed safety performance data,   see page  .   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change

our employee  business resource groups and inclusion councils from outside speakers and fireside chats to listening  sessions, creating a more inclusive environment by engaging  team members is a top priority. one way we do this is through  our employee business resource groups (ebrgs), company- wide team member resource groups that serve as networks  and information resources for all our team members. american’s ebrgs serve as networks for team members  to connect, foster professional and personal development,  learn through cultural engagement activities, serve our  communities and help support american’s business  objectives. american currently has   ebrgs with   local  chapters, and they represent a range of communities with  different beliefs, genders, ethnicities and life experiences.  in  , more than  ,  team members belonged to at  least one ebrg. we expect our senior leaders to model our  commitment to dei by taking an active leadership role in  ebrgs or other dei-related programs.  our ebrgs host and sponsor a variety of programs and  events each year that benefit team members as well as the  communities where they are based. for example, our pride  ebrg

way in which we are working  to advance our dei strategy and promote an inclusive culture.  since  , we have established inclusion councils across  seven different workgroups. they are designed to elicit team  member feedback in the workplace, develop workgroup- specific learning and mentorship programs, and drive action in  policymaking. in  , our inclusion councils hosted nearly    listening sessions, developed action plans and helped influence  policy changes. for example, they worked with unions and our  flight team to promote gender-neutral flight policies.promoting fairness through a commitment to pay equity american has long championed pay equity, and we are  committed to pay parity for the same job regardless of gender,  race or ethnicity. the  % of our workforce that is covered by  collective bargaining agreements has built-in pay equity as  part of those agreements. therefore, we have focused on pay  equity for the remaining  % — made up of leadership and  support staff — who do not belong to unions. american has been using syndio’s workplace equity platform  since  . as a result, we have fine-tuned our methodology for  completing regular pay equity reviews, including most recently  in early  . our approach begins by placing each team  member in one of approximately   “similarly situated groups” (ssgs) across american based on the type of work they do. we  then identify factors that can drive compensation variation within  each ssg, such as an individual’s specific pay scale, seniority  or experience. of course, higher salaries awarded to any new or  existing team members can result in unintended pay gaps.  in  , american became the first airline  to receive fair pay workplace’s  inaugural  pay equity certification, which is based on  a company’s identification and remediation  of pay equity issues. a part of syndio, this  seattle-based organization is working to  dismantle pay disparities based on gender,  race and ethnicity to create sustained fair pay.  strengthening our supplier diversity efforts alongside our work to build a diverse workforce, american is  committed to developing a more inclusive and diverse supplier  base. in  , we strengthened our supplier diversity program  with improvements to our reporting and data infrastructure.  having access to better data makes it easier to track our  progress. our company partnered with supplier.io, a leading  data, analytics and software resource for supplier diversity  programs, and we launched an initiative to provide division- level supplier diversity data to american leaders at every level  of the organization. as the airline industry rebounded, american increased the  percentage of diverse supplier spend in every category  year over year. our total spend with tier   diverse suppliers  increased by  % over  , the second consecutive year american airlines has increased our total spend with diverse  suppliers. our supplier diversity team is also actively engaged  with various organizations working to facilitate sourcing  from qualified, diverse-owned businesses. for example,  team members serve on the boards of directors, as well as  on the certification committees, of the regional councils of  the national minority supplier development council and the  women’s business enterprise national council. partnering with diverse entrepreneurs american is proud to partner with and support diverse  entrepreneurs across the united states. one example is silver  spoon desserts, a chicago-based black woman-owned  company founded by tamara turner. the company’s cakes  have elevated inflight dessert catering for our domestic premium customers. furthermore, the partnership with  american has enabled turner to grow her business and create  new job opportunities in her community.  in addition, as part of a $  million joint investment from  american airlines and british airways,   unique minority- owned and women-owned businesses were awarded contracts  to support the renovation of terminal   at new york’s john  f. kennedy international airport. the total amount of the  contracts exceeds the port authority of new york and new  jersey’s goal for diverse supplier awards. american and  british airways were also proud to award contracts to local  businesses in new york’s borough of queens. the two airlines  welcomed customers to the renovated terminal on dec.  ,  ,  marking the completion of the first phase.   american airlines sustainability report  climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message team members

u.s.  companies in any industry to be certified. the rules and  standards for certification  are available to the public. among the certification requirements, american will undergo  regular check-ins that involve a seven-point review of our  remediation plan. we have also pledged not to ask job  candidates about their prior compensation or expectations for  starting pay, which fair pay workplace has identified as one  of the largest sources of pay gaps.  recruitment recruiting the best talent for all roles across american is  critical to our ongoing success. two areas of particular focus  are pilots and aviation maintenance professionals. in both, we  will need to replace a large number of team members over the  next several years due largely to a wave of retirements. developing a pipeline to the flight deck american hired more than  ,  pilots in   and expects  to recruit more than  ,  in  . the need for pilots has also presented us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to  expand awareness of and access to careers in aviation. we  made progress on this front in  :  % of pilots hired were  women,  % self-identified as black and  % identified as  people of color. at the   women in aviation international  conference in march, american extended   pilot job offers,  and we were the only mainline carrier to extend offers. we must develop a strong pipeline of pilot candidates, and  doing so requires a long-term outlook and commitment. the  american airlines cadet academy is one of the initiatives  that will help us achieve this goal. the cadet academy strives achieving recognition for our dei accomplishments a number of leading organizations and publications that  monitor dei performance have recognized american for our  work in this area. american is the only airline to receive a  perfect score on the human rights campaign foundation’s  corporate equality index every year since the award’s  inception in  . and in  , we were named a noteworthy  company for diversity by diversityinc for the second time. in  addition, we were honored to have the dallas business journal   recognize american’s chief diversity officer with a leader in  diversity award in  .  our dei efforts have also received the highest scores from the  disability equality index  and high scores from the seramount  inclusion index . our ebrgs were recognized in the following ways in   for  their work within american and for their efforts externally to  support our communities: • american finished second as a faith-friendly company in  the corporate religious equity, diversity & inclusion (redi)  index , based in part on the number and variety of our  religion-affiliated ebrgs. the redi index was created by  the religious freedom & business foundation. • our latin diversity network ebrg was ranked among the  top   ergs by latina style magazine , which is dedicated to  the concerns of the contemporary latina professional and  the latina business owner in the united states. • american’s black professional network ebrg won a spot in  the global erg network  list of the top   ergs.identifying pay gaps the chart below shows american’s controlled pay  gap for gender

students are expected to take approximately  three years to complete the program and become airline- ready professional pilots. they are then guaranteed an  interview with one of american’s wholly-owned regional  carriers: envoy air, psa airlines or piedmont airlines. over    cadets have entered the cadet academy since its launch  in  , and more than   now fly for one of these three. since  american has contractual flow-through agreements with each of our regional carriers, pilots who are hired by one of  them have the opportunity to be hired by american’s mainline  carrier based on its hiring needs. in fact, four cadet academy  graduates — all of them women — completed this path in    and joined american as first officers.  the number of cadet academy pilots hired thus far would likely  have been higher, but the pandemic delayed graduation for  some students. for example, it took cadets longer to accumulate  the required  ,  hours of flight time due to reduced flight  opportunities in   and  . we expect the number of cadet  academy pilots we hire to increase in the future.with the addition of tulsa-based spartan college of  aeronautics and technology in october  , the cadet  academy now offers five locations where students can  complete the program. other locations include cae in  phoenix and coast flight training in san diego, dallas,  and san marcos, texas. regardless of where students are  enrolled, each is paired with an american airlines pilot  mentor to guide them through their journey. women and people of color constitute  % of the students  who have entered the cadet academy since its launch in  .  women alone account for  %, and  % of students identify as  building partnerships to recruit   diverse talent we have expanded our recruitment efforts with the goal  of attracting the best diverse talent for all roles. for  example, american belongs to the hbcu partnership  challenge to promote greater engagement and support  between private

pilot training. our commitment totals $   million over the next decade. providing career opportunities in aviation maintenance  american currently employs more than  ,  aviation  maintenance professionals across our hubs and other  locations, and they play a critical role in ensuring the safety of every customer and team member aboard our aircraft.  the partnership we announced in october   with the  aviation institute of maintenance (aim)  will help us replenish  their ranks and provide students with a direct career path to  american. these are well-paying jobs with opportunities for  advancement, and they do not require an advanced degree. aim is the largest aviation maintenance training organization  in the united states, with   federal aviation administration- certificated aviation maintenance schools around the  country. approximately  ,  students are currently pursuing  certifications to become aircraft mechanics in aim’s  -month  program. as part of our agreement, american will guarantee  interviews for top candidates from aim’s chicago campus.  we will also provide students with opportunities to engage  with aircraft maintenance teams at our facilities across the  country. eligible students will be offered financial assistance  for certification exams as well as a complete set of tools  to start their careers off on the right foot. for american  team members who are interested in becoming aviation  maintenance professionals, aim will offer reduced tuition  rates and waive its application fee at any of its campuses. talent development training and development are vital to giving our team members  the tools and resources they need to do their best. our annual  performance appraisal process aligns team member goals  with the company’s objectives relating to operational reliability,  profitability and accountability. it also identifies areas of  development for the individual and provides connections to the  company’s broad range of training programs, which provide  opportunities for career growth. american spent about $   million on functional and professional development training in   , roughly $ ,  per person.working with obap to expand access to  careers in aviation  american donated $ .  million in   to the organization  of black aerospace professionals (obap). founded in   , this nonprofit is dedicated to the encouragement and  advancement of minorities in all aviation and aerospace  careers. american’s donation includes a $ ,  grant  to obap’s luke weathers jr. flight academy in olive  branch, mississippi, while the rest will be used to fund  scholarships for the flight school’s students. at obap's   th annual conference in august  , american  extended   job offers to pilots, making us the only  mainline carrier to offer employment to attendees. we also hosted more than   students at our facilities  throughout the summer as a part of obap’s aerospace  career education (ace) academy. the ace academy  provides

members with scholarships of up to $ ,   to attend a two-year, four-year or trade school, with an  additional $ ,  scholarship for first-generation students. human rights although we believe that governments are primarily  responsible for safeguarding human rights, we endeavor  to conduct our business in a socially responsible and  ethical manner consistent with human rights principles. our approach to human rights is guided by international  standards, and we respect and support the following: • united nations (u.n.) guiding principles on business   and human rights  • organisation for economic co-operation and  development’s guidelines for multinational enterprises • core conventions of the international labour  organization (ilo)  • ilo’s declaration on fundamental principles and   rights at work • u.n. universal declaration of human rights the american airlines human rights statement  applies  to all team members and contractors, employees of our  wholly-owned carriers, and our suppliers and other business  relationships. we continually evaluate our operations and  value chain to identify, assess and address human rights risks  and to engage key stakeholders. this evaluation is carried out  as part of american’s overall assessment process of critical  and significant suppliers for sustainability risks, as outlined in  our procurement policy. our statement complements our annual team member  training on the standards of business conduct. we also  provide a dedicated  /  hotline for team members, suppliers  and partners to report human rights concerns anonymously.  american does not tolerate any retribution or retaliation taken  against any individual who has, in good faith, sought advice or  reported questionable behavior or a possible violation. respecting freedom of association  as outlined in our human rights statement, american  respects freedom of association and our team members’  right to join, or not join, third-party organizations such as    american airlines sustainability report  climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message team members indexes & data customers labor unions or other lawful organizations of their own  selection, and we do not interfere with these organizations.  we also respect the right to bargain or not bargain  collectively, in accordance with local laws, without fear   of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. as of the end of    ,  % of our workforce was covered by collective  bargaining agreements. human trafficking prevention we believe american has become an industry leader in  combating human trafficking and child exploitation. we have  mandatory human trafficking awareness training for our frontline,  customer-facing team members — including flight attendants,  pilots and airport customer service representatives — as well as  for team members with international purchasing responsibilities.  this training is required for new hires and as part of our recurrent  training programs. we know that vigilance is key in fighting the  scourge of human trafficking, and we stand ready to help. we  also regularly update our reporting and security processes  with the latest information and best practices. american’s collaboration with government agencies, industry  partners and nongovernmental organizations is a key part of  our human trafficking prevention program. we work with a  range of partners, including the following:  • the u.s. department of homeland security (dhs) blue  campaign , a national public awareness effort that aims  to educate the public, law enforcement and industry  partners to recognize the indicators of human trafficking.  in early  , american spearheaded airportwide training  with dhs at ronald reagan washington national airport.  more than   people participated in this session,  including american team members, employees of other airlines, the transportation security administration and  the metropolitan washington airports authority, as well  as vendors. we expect to schedule additional training   at other hubs.  • new friends new life (nfnl) , a dallas-based  organization working to restore and empower formerly  trafficked teenage girls and sexually exploited women  and their children. according to nfnl research, texas  ranks second in the country for trafficking prevalence,  with more than  ,  victims annually statewide. by  providing access to education, job training, financial  assistance and mental health support, nfnl helps  women and their children overcome backgrounds of  abuse, addiction, poverty and limited opportunities. in  collaboration with three of our ebrgs — professional  women in aviation, black professional network and  latin diversity network — american has hosted a  human trafficking awareness presentation by nfnl for  the past four years at our fort worth headquarters. in   , the event was attended by   team members. • texas businesses against trafficking , a public-private  awareness and prevention initiative led by the texas  secretary of state. our legal team oversees the company’s compliance with  applicable domestic and international modern slavery and  human trafficking laws. in june  , we published the  annual update of american’s modern slavery and human  trafficking statement  to comply with the u.k. modern  slavery act of   and australia’s modern slavery act of   . american is also a signatory to the pact tourism  child-protection code of conduct , a voluntary set of  business principles to prevent child sex tourism and the  trafficking of children. for detailed team member diversity data,   see page  . for board diversity data, see  page   of our   proxy statement . indexes & data team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message  customers we rigorously measure and track customer satisfaction  through passenger surveys, using the results to implement  improvements across our operations.  of course, dependability and reliability are the foundation  for meeting customer needs. our chief priority remains the  same — getting customers to their destinations safely, on  schedule and with their baggage in tow, and we closely track  our performance on these metrics. our airline also places a  high value on fairness and accuracy in our communications,  and we go to great lengths to implement cybersecurity  measures and protect our customers’ privacy. working to improve operations as air travel approaches  pre-pandemic levels in  , american transported more than   million  passengers, a  % increase over the previous year. despite  this growth, our   completion factor — the percentage  of flights that weren’t canceled — fell by less than one  percentage point to  . %.  on-time performance for the year dipped by just over four  percentage points to  . %. this was due largely to the rapid  and significant expansion of our operations over the summer  amid challenging weather conditions, especially around some of our major hub airports in the south and on the east  coast. thanks to resilient planning and the integration of  new technologies, we were able to improve our performance  through the end of the year. the fourth quarter saw significant  improvements in completion factor and on time arrivals  despite significant impacts from winter storm elliott, when  weather cancellations rose significantly. american recovered  quickly from the storm and outperformed other carriers on  completion factor, and we were able to achieve the best  december holiday performance in the industry. we are constantly developing and evaluating new  technologies with the potential to improve our operations.  among those rolled out in  , the hub efficiency analytics  tool (heat) helps reduce cancellations in the face of major  weather events and other extraordinary situations. heat  uses real-time and historical data to help american’s hub  operations manage through and recover faster from such  events. it evaluates load factors, connections, crew legalities  and gate availability to adjust departure and arrival times on  hundreds of flights in a coordinated way. we deployed heat    times during the past year, preventing more than    cancellations at dallas fort worth international airport (dfw)  and charlotte douglas international airport (clt) alone.serving our customers american airlines is committed to providing our customers with a world-class travel  experience. flying to more than   destinations in the united states and internationally,  we continually look for ways to improve and lead our industry by strengthening  operational performance and enhancing service offerings.    american airlines sustainability report   ceo message sustainability  strategy climate change safety team members indexes & data   customers  our smart gating technology, which we introduced at major  hubs in  , is also leading to greater efficiencies. by routing  aircraft to available gates more quickly, this tool can provide  customers with more time to make connecting flights. in   , it reduced taxi times by a total of more than   hours  per day at dfw, clt and miami international airport. smart  gating is yielding important environmental benefits as well,  which you can read about on page  . enhancing the customer experience   on the ground and in flight we work hard to provide exceptional service. in  ,  american continued to offer resources that help customers  travel with confidence. through our ongoing verifly  partnership, we help passengers understand and verify their  requirements for international travel. verifly’s mobile health  wallet makes it easy for passengers to upload the forms they  need to get verified status for travel. our customers who  use verifly can also use our mobile app and aa.com to get  mobile boarding passes and take advantage of dedicated and  expedited check-in lanes at several airports.  customers traveling internationally can access our ready to  fly hub when viewing their eligible reservations on aa.com or  through the american airlines mobile app. its checklist outlines  everything they need for travel. in  , we made enhancements to the american airlines  app, giving customers the flexibility to pay for products and  services while using its chat function. team members also use  mobile devices around the gate to scan boarding passes and  gate-check bags or provide other support for customers with  children or mobility issues. this helped improve the customer  experience by making navigating the airport more convenient  for our passengers. in  , our customer service efforts were recognized for the fifth consecutive year by the apex official  airline ratings — global airline category. american received  a prestigious five star rating based on verified customer  feedback on the overall travel experience. among our inflight improvements in  , we completed an  ongoing project that expanded overhead bin capacity by  %  on the airbus   and  % on the boeing  . customers  appreciate having more space for carry-on luggage, and  the percentage of our fleet with expanded bin capacity will  continue to grow as we take deliveries of new aircraft. american has high-speed wi-fi on more mainline aircraft  than any other carrier. our free inflight entertainment gives  customers traveling on our domestic narrowbody aircraft  access to innovative, exclusive and diverse content directly on  their personal devices at no cost. that includes some of the  most anticipated live events in football and soccer annually  as well as news networks. in  , we added offerings that  promote wellness on the go. among them, obé fitness features  a variety of classes that offer soothing in-seat stretches, simple  twists, healthy-eating hacks, relaxing breathwork and more. in march  , american became the first u.s. airline to  guarantee family seating. we now seat children   and  under adjacent to an accompanying adult at no additional  cost, assuming they meet certain conditions outlined in our  customer service plan . posting record customer satisfaction scores based on a sampling of approximately   million customer  surveys, american’s likelihood to recommend (ltr) score  rose to a company-best  .  for  . that represents a  gain of  .

members and nonmembers.  we share feedback with our customer service and food  service teams as well as our airport teams to identify areas  for improvement. for example, in the new terminal b at  laguardia airport (lga) in new york city, we learned from  survey results that frequent travelers were dissatisfied  because the tsa precheck location was too far from  american’s check-in and bag drop area. working together  with lga leadership, we convinced tsa to move the  security checkpoint to a new, dedicated area. we took a  similar approach for customers without tsa precheck and  positioned the check-in and bag drop area so that it is directly  in front of the main entry for their security checkpoint.  american is currently establishing a partner survey process  across the   member airlines of the oneworld® alliance,  including our west coast international alliance with alaska  airlines. we expect the survey to launch in  . emphasizing fairness and accuracy in our  communications we are in business to provide safe, dependable and friendly  air transportation to our customers, and we work hard to  make their experience a positive one. at the same time,  averaging  ,  scheduled departures per day is challenging  and complex. inevitably, some of our flights are affected by  adverse circumstances — some within our control and others  not. when that happens, our customer service plan outlines  the many policies and processes we have put in place to ensure that american’s customers are treated fairly and  receive the assistance they need.  american is also committed to accuracy in our communications  and marketing. to help customers make informed decisions,  we provide information about the benefits of flying with  american and strive to represent fairly the social or environ- mental benefits of our activities. we endeavor not to mislead  vulnerable market segments, such as children, about our  services. moreover, we do not publish or otherwise share  information about our competitors or other companies that   is knowingly false or could discredit them. responding swiftly to customer concerns  the ability to respond swiftly to any customer concerns is a  critical part of our approach to customer satisfaction. during peak times, when our response may not be as rapid as we  would like, we have tools in place such as chat through the  mobile app, automated callback and immediate, automated  correspondence to update customers with the most relevant  information for their travels. we also share reports of  customer concerns quarterly with senior executives and our  board of directors. our customer experience leadership team  receives information about customer correspondence daily.  american is especially focused on comments that allege  discriminatory behavior, and we have empowered a special  customer relations team to increase awareness of such  complaints among customer-facing team members. each  allegation is investigated, and disciplinary action — up to  and including termination — can result if we determine that  unacceptable behavior occurred.    american airlines sustainability report   ceo message sustainability  strategy climate change safety team members indexes & data   customers meeting the needs of diverse customers american’s approach to customer engagement reflects our  commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. we continue  to rely on the guidance of the community council we  formed in   to provide objective and candid insights on  company initiatives, particularly those focused on improving  the customer travel experience and meeting the needs of  underrepresented customer groups. in  , we launched our “no limits” ad campaign to help us  authentically and meaningfully connect with black travelers.  created by walton isaacson, our multicultural agency of  record, the campaign runs primarily on minority-owned media  platforms to ensure that we reach our intended audience. in  addition, through our james beard foundation sponsorship,  american features menu items from diverse chefs in our  flagship lounges and flagship first dining locations. we implement procedures across our operations with the  goal of treating all customers equitably. for example, to  help remove potential bias during the boarding process, we  updated our standby and upgrade list process to clear all  requests automatically if seats are available. prioritizing cybersecurity and data privacy cybersecurity and data privacy are key priorities at american  airlines. in  , we published a new cybersecurity policy  statement , and we updated our privacy policy  in march  . american’s approach to identifying and mitigating  cybersecurity risk is aligned with the national institute of  standards and technology cybersecurity framework. the  program, which includes policies, standards and a variety of technical security solutions to prevent and respond to  cybersecurity issues, is evaluated annually by a global  cybersecurity firm.  the chief information security officer is responsible  for cybersecurity and reports to the chief digital and  information officer, who is a member of our senior  management team. our board of directors oversees   our work on cybersecurity, with the audit committee  regularly reviewing cyber and data privacy risks and  receiving briefings from senior leaders on these matters   at least quarterly.  our company also has a formal cybersecurity training and  awareness program focused on educating our team members  about cybersecurity risk and our internal policies and  procedures related to cybersecurity, privacy and compliance.  certain trainings — such as basic data security awareness  — are conducted annually, and all team members and  contractors are expected to complete it. a number of team members undergo additional  cybersecurity and data privacy training depending on their  roles and responsibilities. we also review the cybersecurity  profile of suppliers as part of our risk management strategy  and engage certain suppliers on their practices.  american’s privacy program, which is audited annually, is led  by our chief privacy and data protection officer and staffed  with certified privacy professionals. we also have a privacy  council composed of more than   senior leaders who meet  quarterly to discuss privacy issues, challenges and proposed  solutions. the council is supported by approximately    privacy liaisons across the business. the privacy program is guided by key privacy principles that  inform how american handles and protects the personal  information in our care, such as responsibility, transparency,  security and choice. our privacy office regularly conducts  privacy impact assessments of business processes and  supporting information technology (it) systems that process  personal data. the primary role of these assessments is to  identify and remediate associated privacy risks.  information obtained from privacy impact assessments is  used to populate our personal data inventory, which details  what personal data our company stores, how it is used,  where it is stored, with whom it is shared and for how long  it is retained. we supplement these efforts by coordinating  with our it department to incorporate privacy design  requirements into the architecture and operation of our  systems that store and process personal data. we also use  these processes to fulfill our legal requirements for handling  data rights requests and data disclosures via our internal  and external privacy policies and statements. our team members take privacy training courses annually,  and the privacy office conducts individual training sessions  with different business units each year that address a  variety of privacy issues. we also coordinate closely with our  vendor management and corporate legal functions, which  provide input on privacy terms and provisions in agreements  with our business partners and vendors to ensure that  privacy issues are appropriately addressed. contractors  are required to take a course on global data privacy and  protection annually or as they sign on. for operational performance data,   see page  .   american airlines sustainability report   ceo message sustainability  strategy climate change safety team

to express an opinion on the ghg examination subject matter based on  our examination, and to express a conclusion on the ghg review subject matter based on our review. our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the american institute  of certified public accountants in at -c section  , concepts common to all attestation engagements , and  at-c section  , examination engagements . those standards require that we plan and perform the  examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ghg examination subject matter is in  accordance with the criteria , in all material respects. an examination involves performing procedures to obtain  evidence about the ghg examination subject matter. the nature, timing, and extent of the procedures  selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ghg  examination subject matter, w hether due to fraud or error. we believe that the evidence we obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the american institute of

to  obtain limited assurance about whether any material mo difications should be made to the ghg review subject  matter in order for it to be in accordance with the criteria . the procedures performed in a review vary in nature  and timing from and are substantially less in extent than an examination, the objective o f which is to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the ghg review subject matter is in accordance with the criteria , in all  material respects, in order to express an opinion. accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. because of  the limited natur e of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the  assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed. we believe that the review  evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to pro vide a reasonable basis for our conclusion. we are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant  ethical requirements related to the engagement. the procedures we performed in our review were based on our professional judgment and consisted primarily  of inquiries of management to obtain an understanding of the methodology and inputs used in deriving the  ghg review subject matter, recalculating a selection of the ghg review subject matter based on the  methodology and inputs identified by management, and performing analytical procedures over the ghg  review subject matter .  our examination was limited to the ghg examination subject matter presented in the ghg statement and our  review was limited to the ghg review subject matter presented in the ghg statement. the report includes  other information, metrics, and prospective information that were not subject to our examination or review  procedures. accordingly, we do not express an opinion, conclusion, or any o ther form of assurance on such  information, the assumptions and achievability of prospective information, or metrics in the report . as described in note  of the ghg statement, emissions data are subject to measurement uncertainties  resulting from limitati ons inherent in the nature and methods of determining such data. obtaining sufficient  appropriate examination evidence to support our opinion and sufficient appropriate review evidence to support  our conclusion does not reduce the inherent uncertainty in t he data. the selection by management of different  but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different measurements. in our opinion, the ghg examination subject matter is in accordance with the criteria , in all material respect s. based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the ghg review  subject matter in order for it to be in accordance with the criteria . dallas, texas july ,    kpmg   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data  customers team members climate change

ed bastian   climate and the environment   appendix  table of contents travel can change the world. for good.  introduction  in  , delta soared out of the pandemic era  and into stabilization and recovery. we returned  to the skies and found that, once again, the world  is a better place thanks to the miracle of safe,  efficient and comfortable air travel that connects  people and communities worldwide. all of this is possible thanks to the dedication,  passion and hard work of the  , + people of  delta air lines. because of their efforts, delta was  the most awarded airline in the country in  ,  earning recognition from fortune as the world’s  most admired airline for the  th year; being  honored as the most reliable airline by the wall  street journal; and being awarded for outstanding  customer service and innovation by the points  guy, popular science, the beat and more. as we look ahead,   is a year in which we  continue to transform travel with bold new  initiatives like free in-flight wi-fi and delta sync,  a platform to further enhance and personalize  the travel experience at all points of the journey.  amid our progress, we will always stay true to  our people-oriented values that drive everything we do. to that end, we will continue to focus   on the following: making safety our no.   priority, always safety is in our dna. in  , we continued to  put our safety culture front and center as we  onboarded thousands of new delta employees.  our long-standing commitment to our “just  culture” initiative instills in new employees the  mindset that every mistake is an opportunity  to learn and that transparency without fear or  punishment is essential to keeping our people and  customers safe. just culture uses collaboration,  observation and conversations to review and  investigate safety issues and prevent them in the  future – teaching by showing, not telling. the program is one of many tools we utilize daily  to ensure that safety always comes first. powered by people and culture our people have always been at the heart of our  success, which is why investing in them was  a primary focus of  . despite the lingering  financial challenges of the pandemic, we recognized our people’s excellence with a special  profit-sharing payment totaling $  million in  february  . three months later, we announced  a  % pay increase for eligible employees  worldwide. finally, in february  , we were  happy to pay $  million in   profit-sharing  checks to our employees. delta’s commitment to our employees’ financial  well-being isn’t solely about pay – it’s about the  ability to manage personal finances and save  for emergencies as well as retirement. research  shows that one-third of u.s. households cannot  come up with $  cash to cover an emergency  expense. to address this problem, we developed  a program in partnership with operation hope  and fidelity investments to give every delta  employee access to a $ ,  emergency savings  account and an online financial education and  coaching program. in addition, we continue to  offer our leading  (k) program in which over   % of our employees participated in  ,  featuring a  % automatic contribution with  another  % company match.a message from ed bastian ed bastian   ceo delta air lines introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix  building a more equitable world delta is committed to pushing toward a more  just and equitable world for all. that includes  a commitment to improving the diversity of  our people at all levels of the company, with  measurable goals and transparency that we  outline in our annual “close the gap” report.  while we still have a long journey ahead, we  are heartened to report that delta increased the  representation of women, black talent and other  underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in  roles across the company in  . additionally, delta accelerated an essential  partnership with oneten, an organization  that aims to hire, promote and advance one  million black individuals into family-sustaining  careers over ten years. our intentional skills- first approach to identifying talent removes  unnecessary barriers to higher-earning jobs  and careers, such as eliminating four-year  college degree requirements for most roles  and establishing a skills-first apprenticeship  program and occupation-specific academies –  like our propel program for pilot talent.flying toward a sustainable future in  , focus on climate and the environment  took on a larger role within delta as we expanded  our leadership oversight to cement sustainability  as a core business imperative. we promoted  peter carter to executive vice president of  external affairs, expanding his role leading delta’s  legal, regulatory and government affairs functions  to also oversee the airline’s international,  innovation and sustainability strategy. we also  welcomed chief sustainability officer, pam  fletcher, to lead our journey to net-zero emissions  by  , focusing on short-, medium- and long- term initiatives. in the short term, the delta  team is having an immediate impact by reducing  single-use plastic consumption on board,  electrifying our ground operations and integrating  a sustainable mindset across our supply chain.  we are building partnerships now to help create  an economically viable market for sustainable  aviation fuel in the years ahead as innovation   and technology expand the nascent industry. our fleet continues to improve its efficiency,  and last year we ordered   boeing  -   aircraft that will be  –  % more fuel efficient  than the planes they will replace. delta’s  carbon council, which scours our operation   for improvements to fuel efficiency, saved over    million gallons last year thanks to enhanced winglet installations for drag reduction, weight  reduction initiatives and flight routing and  speed optimizations. and we’re investing now in technology that  carries the potential to have a significant impact  over the long term, such as our partnership  with joby aviation, which will revolutionize the  customer journey by offering sustainable home- to-airport travel utilizing electric vertical takeoff  and landing aircraft. serving our communities delta has long been committed to the  communities where we live, work and serve.  we focus our giving on the environment, equity,  education and wellness while supporting  our armed forces and veterans and anti- human trafficking programs, partnering with  organizations like american red cross, captain  planet, junior achievement and uncf, among  others. as we return to profitability, we continue  our commitment to contributing  % of the  company’s profits to communities worldwide.  while funding nonprofit partners is critical, the  thousands of delta people who step up and  volunteer every year drive our spirit of service.  in  , their work included assembling nearly   ,  bikes for marine toys for tots at delta  techops, volunteering to provide meals at hosea helps on martin luther king jr. day to  celebrate his life and work and donating  ,   units of life-saving blood to the american red  cross, making delta its no.   corporate blood  drive sponsor for  . that dedication is  why delta was again recognized on the civic    as one of the   most community-minded  companies in the u.s. last year by points of  light, the world’s largest organization dedicated  to volunteer service. we are excited about the years ahead and  humbled by the experiences of the global  pandemic. as we return to the skies, the  lessons of recent years will always remain  with us – a reminder of the power of human  connection and the clarity that helps us  embrace what is really important in our lives. i welcome all our customers, employees,  investors and community partners to join us   on this ongoing journey.

appendix  safety  safety is our number one  priority. as an airline,  health, safety and security  are non-negotiable and  operating a safe and reliable  airline is the underpinning  of our success. we are  grateful and privileged that  our customers, colleagues  and communities entrust  us with their transportation  needs. safety for our  employees and customers is  a foundational commitment  that permeates our culture.in conjunction with our organization-wide safety  policy, we designed the sms to be proactive,  predictive and data-driven in nature. delta  was an early adopter of sms principles, and in   , we were one of the first airlines to receive  validation from the faa several months before  the requirement to do so. as our sms accountable executive (ae), delta’s  ceo retains ultimate responsibility for the  sms and has final authority for delta’s safety  performance. the ae and delta leadership  committee (dlc) are committed to providing  the necessary resources to ensure our sms  remains healthy and effective. they are briefed  regularly on our safety performance.  for the sms to remain effective, we rely on  continuous, open reporting from our employees.  we investigate all safety reports fairly and fully.  we will not take disciplinary action against an  employee for reporting safety hazards, concerns safety management system delta’s safety management system (sms) is a leader-driven, process-oriented approach   to ensuring occupational and operational safety through identifying hazards, assessing and  mitigating risk, monitoring our safety performance and promoting a positive safety culture.   we apply safety risk management (srm) to  identify hazards that could lead to an accident  or incident. for example: implementation of new systems,   such as a new aircraft type  revision of existing systems,   such as procedural or manual changes development of new procedures, such   as adding new airports to our network identification of new hazards or   ineffective risk controls through   our safety assurance processesor incidents, including when an error occurs  while the employee acts in good faith. delta  is committed to a positive, just safety culture  where every employee is empowered to stop the  operation at any time to address safety concerns  impacting our customers, people or equipment.leadership policy

demonstrated daily through the  unwavering commitment of our flight attendants, pilots, maintenance  technicians and ground agents. it is critical for delta and the broader airline industry to utilize all the  tools available to mitigate in-flight misconduct and maintain safe flight  experiences for our customers. delta maintains a zero-tolerance policy  toward workplace violence. we provide de-escalation and self-defense  training for flight attendants and other frontline employees and continue  to partner with law enforcement to increase security at dozens of airports  to protect our passengers and employees. we will continue collaborating  industry-wide on solutions, including maintaining a no-fly list and  cooperating with local, state and federal authorities on the prosecution

to pick up, cleanliness remains a fundamental element of delta brand expectations.  we are committed to delivering a world-class customer experience through the delta carestandardsm,  our science-backed approach to health and safety. global cleanliness supports the delta brand promise,  as we move forward on our commitment to clean travel experiences.  employee safety the safety of our employees in delivering operations  is an enterprise-wide responsibility and is deeply  embedded in our culture.  we empower our employees to slow down or stop any operation if they  feel it is necessary to maintain a safe work environment for our personnel  and a safe travel experience for our customers. we operate several cross- divisional and division-specific employee safety programs that help to  achieve our safety objectives. these programs are critical to preventing  serious injuries by proactively approaching and encouraging safety dialogue  across the company. we have regular safety time-out reminders and  exercises across our entire operation. in  , delta hired a record number of new full-time employees, approximately   , , to support the rising demand for post-pandemic travel. to successfully  integrate this significant influx of new employees, investments were made to  adapt and improve our many safety training and management programs and to  account for the rise in travel demand.  ythe delta carestandard sm organizes a team of  clean ambassadors dedicated to overseeing  consistent cleaning quality by delta employees,  cabin service cleaners and janitorial partners.  ydelta partners with lysol® pro solutions and the  purell® brand to implement science-backed  cleaning technologies and protocols designed  to ensure surfaces have been disinfected using  methods approved by trusted experts.  ydelta continues to use air filtration systems on  jet bridges and focuses on air quality onboard  through continuous filtering and refreshing  cabin air.our clean ambassadors domestically serve    airports as cleanliness champions. these  champions support cleaning team members across  our areas and aircraft, ensuring we follow end-to- end cleanliness protocols and provide customers  with a first-class delta experience. we use trusted  partnerships and a commitment to continuous  improvement to prioritize health and wellness.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix safety programs delta provides a suite of safety  training that includes compliance  requirements as well as tailored  information relevant to an  employee’s role:   regular quality assurance audits  and employee interviews are  performed at domestic and  international airports to evaluate  the implementation and success  of these initiatives and programs.  the audit findings and interview  results are shared with leaders to  proactively identify opportunity  areas and best practices. just culture – one of our long-established safety initiatives  – is at the forefront to emphasize its importance to new  employees within delta. just culture uses collaboration,  observations and conversations, such as peer-to-peer or  manager-to-employee, to investigate safety incidents and to  prevent them in the future, teaching by showing rather than  by telling. just culture is a mindset that focuses on learning  from good faith mistakes rather than punishment or blaming.  safety culture – in late  , we completed safety culture  assessments at three of our larger u.s. airports – lax, slc  and den. the results were validated by an external airport  leadership team. following the validation, grassroots  teams representing frontline and mid-level leadership  employees were established to address challenges  identified in the assessment. projects addressed “cultural norms” with teams applying  simple culture-based tools to develop an understanding of  the beliefs, perceptions and assumptions that support those  norms. during  , this approach was used for projects  such as safety time-outs, vehicle use and care, leaders  setting the tone for safety, ergonomic behaviors and team lifts and sharing safety concerns and mistakes. having those  individuals closest to the work drive change in their areas and  engage with peers in the development of solutions created  shared success.  the ground safety advocate (gsa) program launched,  bringing to life the just culture concept by assisting new  employees in practicing their peer-to-peer communication  skills about safety concerns to promote best safety practices.  we expanded the network of health centrals (onsite health  and well-being centers within airports) to provide immediate  physical therapy, proactive treatments and exercise routines  and, in many cases, access to gym equipment.  investments in ground handling equipment were made,  such as powerstows (i.e., advanced belt loaders that  can transport bags inside aircraft cargo bins), and other  significant, continued investment in our eligible gse fleet,  including electrification. l  leading safety – a unified, cross-divisional learning  program for safety leaders – was launched to enhance  leadership skills and hear advice and lessons learned from  other leaders across the company.  a back-to-basics course in occupational safety and health  administration (osha) requirements and injury case  management is in place to better position frontline leadership  personnel to conduct more accurate, timely and complete  injury investigations.flight safety – we have made further enhancements to  our safety assurance process through proactive key safety  performance indicators directly related to the operation of  an aircraft. these precursors allow better insights within  an evolving environment and deliver risks to appropriate  stakeholders before they become larger concerns. delta held its first annual safety and environmental  summit in late  , bringing together the frontline safety  and environmental leaders across the company. this two-  day event included messages from delta’s divisional and  corporate leaders, keynote speakers and breakout sessions  to deliver more detailed information on specific topics. we communicated the importance of safety through weekly  videos, internal posts, town halls, daily interactions with  leaders and within workspaces to supplement training and  embed a culture of safety.  safety at a glance trir   (total recordable injury rate)  .  dart   (days away,

will have  shared broadly delta’s go-forward sustainability  strategy that is rooted in two pillars: embedding  sustainability in everything we do; and  eliminating our climate impact from flying.  within these pillars, all of our work – ongoing and  ahead of us – will be organized under these focus  areas: the travel experience, supply chain, ground  operations, efficient aircraft operations, clean  fuel and revolutionary fleet. work is already well  underway in all these areas. i’m more optimistic than ever about our future  because of the progress we’ve made and the  foundation we’ve laid to accelerate. all of this  work is as important to our business as it is to  our planet, and i’m excited about the journey  because there’s no team on the planet better   at blazing new trails.  pam fletcher  chief sustainability officer & corporate innovation  delta air lines, inc.when i joined delta on february  ,  ,  the power and passion of delta people was  palpable. our green up business resource  group of more than  ,  employees was  spearheading tree plantings and waterway  cleanups in various delta hub communities,  while pitching solutions for reducing single- use plastics and more. likewise, fuel efficiency  programs that teams across delta accelerated  during the pandemic – from what we fly, how  we fly and the fuel we use – were blossoming.  i’m excited to share this section of our esg  report because it illustrates the strong progress  and momentum we collectively built throughout    on our journey to reach net-zero emissions  by  , while delivering a sustainable, elevated  travel experience.  none of what we do or what needs to be  done can be accomplished alone. being part  of what’s classified as a hard-to-decarbonize  sector means it’s going to take all stakeholders  – delta people, partners, regulators, customers,  communities, innovators, other airlines and  others – doing more than our part to meet  delta’s and our industry’s ambitious goals.a few highlights include:  creating greater demand signals for the grossly under- supplied sustainable aviation fuel (saf) market – saf  is the single greatest lever we have today to drastically  cut aviation’s emissions, but there’s not enough  supply produced annually to fuel commercial airlines  globally for a single day; reducing fuel consumption by over   million  gallons in   through the work of the delta  carbon council; introducing new aircraft to our fleet and placing  orders for additional aircraft that operate significantly  more efficiently than aircraft they’re replacing; eliminating approximately  .  million pounds of single- use plastics while elevating the onboard experience  with sustainable options like bamboo cutlery and  canned premium beverages; electrifying

plan  to guide our path towards  . our long-term    target along with our glide path to net- zero is still pending sbti approval. in february   , sbti issued a technical report detailing an  interim pathway for aviation companies to set  . °c-aligned targets and announced plans to  launch a formal update to target-setting guidance  for the aviation sector consistent with limiting  warming to  . °c. given the rapidly evolving  landscape, delta plans to monitor further sbti  guidance, working with our counterparts and a a  to align as an industry on a unified approach that  commits to ambitious targets, which will drive  meaningful change. our ability to achieve our ambitious climate  goals depends on a combination of science,  technology, innovation, government policy and  partnerships. achievement will require, among  other things, significant capital investment  (including from third parties), research and  development from manufacturers and other  stakeholders and progression of government  policies and incentives. these actions are critical  to reduce the cost and increase production  of saf and other technologies that are not  presently in existence or available at scale.    non-co e effects which may also contribute to aviation-induced warming are not included in this target. delta commits to report publicly on its collaboration with stakeholders to improve understanding   of opportunities to mitigate the non-co e impacts of aviation annually over its target timeframe.   carbon emissions intensity was materially impacted in   and   by lower

we will need  to use all levers commercially and economically  available to us now and in the future. our path  focuses on two main pillars:  fleet our fleet renewal efforts have the most  significant impact on reducing emissions  and emissions intensity from our airline  operations. in  , we took delivery of    aircraft that were, on average,  % more fuel  efficient per seat mile than aircraft retired  since  , contributing to a fleet-wide fuel  efficiency improvement of  . % compared  to  . we also announced a series of new  aircraft purchase agreements. we expect  these purchase agreements to bolster our fleet  renewal plans and continue to improve fuel  efficiency in future periods.fuel sustainable aviation fuel (saf) is central to  reducing the life cycle emissions from aviation  fuel; however, it is not currently available at the  scale or cost necessary to meet the industry’s  needs. we have established a goal of replacing   % of our jet fuel consumption with saf

hydrocarbon fuel synthetically produced using renewable or waste-derived  feedstock. it will play a key role in aviation’s decarbonization pathway but is currently  unavailable at scale or price parity with conventional jet fuel. for the aviation industry to achieve net-zero by  , an  exponential increase to  –  billion gallons of saf per    year by   could be required.   critical building blocks for scaling saf include: government incentives:  performance-based, as well as feedstock- and technology- neutral incentives are required to help drive investment toward  the development of saf at a reasonable cost. for example, at the  federal level, a  -year saf-specific blenders tax credit coupled  with a dedicated grant program are some of the policy supports  necessary to help catalyze the domestic market. additionally,  at the state level, incentives and programs such as california’s  low carbon fuel standard’s voluntary opt-in program for saf  need to be more widely adopted to bring saf to other geographic  locations economically. as international governments seek to drive  investment in saf, we caution that mandates without incentives  will fail to ensure sufficient supply and reasonable pricing.what is sustainable aviation fuel? saf is an alternative jet fuel that achieves lower life cycle ghg emissions  compared to conventional jet fuel using various feedstocks such as used  cooking oil, cellulosic waste and municipal solid waste. approved conversion  processes produce saf, such as fischer-tropsch, hefa (hydroprocessed  esters and fatty acids) and co-processing. we do not procure or accept   saf made from palm oil or pfad (palm fatty acid distillate).  y in the context of the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for  international aviation (corsia), the international civil aviation  organization (icao) developed saf sustainability requirements that  include minimum emissions reductions, land use and food security  considerations, among other factors. saf must meet these requirements  to be eligible for compliance with corsia.  y icao has approved two entities, the international sustainability and  carbon certification (iscc) and roundtable of sustainable biomaterials  (rsb) to certify the sustainability of saf.saf accounting framework:  one of the benefits of saf is that it can be delivered and  stored as a “drop-in fuel” using existing pipelines and storage  infrastructure. however, an effective book-and-claim framework  will be necessary from a carbon accounting perspective because  saf comingles with conventional jet fuel. current feedstock and technologies can produce saf with up to   % lower life cycle emissions than conventional jet fuel, with the  ability to blend with conventional jet fuel at up to  %. delta aims to procure more than   million gallons of saf  annually in an effort to achieve a goal of  % saf utilization by  the end of  . in  , we signed offtake agreements with gevo  and dg fuels, bringing our procured   saf gallons to  m.  we continue to purchase from and align with leaders in the saf  industry to accelerate our yearly procurement. we have negotiated  offtake arrangements for future saf supply with these suppliers:     according to the air transport action group (atag), an independent coalition providing a platform for the commercial aviation sector to collaborate on long-term sustainability issues.gevo:   million gallons  annually produced by using  industrial field corn  aemetis:   million gallons  annually produced by utilizing  used cooking oil and tallow as  feedstock dg fuels:   million gallons  annually produced by using  timber waste nwab:   million gallons  annually produced by utilizing  slash, forest residues and mill  residues   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix life cycle emissions of fuel from well-to-wake life cycle emissions account for the ghg emissions at every stage of  the fuel’s life – from development and production to its ultimate use.  we have reported “tank-to-wake” combustion emissions since   as  part of our greenhouse gas emissions inventory. sustainable aviation  fuel emissions are reported on a full life cycle “well-to-wake” basis to  demonstrate the emissions reductions. beginning in  , and again in   , our ghg emissions data includes “well-to-wake” fuel emissions  to increase transparency and follow sbti guidance.  life cycle emissions from saf can currently be up to  % lower than  conventional jet fuel because the feedstock production either absorbs  carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or avoids generating ghg emissions  associated with the disposal and decomposition of the feedstock as  a waste. for bio-based feedstocks, the analysis also considers the  potential ghg emissions increases from indirect land use changes  (iluc) and life cycle assessment (lca). sustainable aviation fuel (continued) delivery of this fuel is subject to timely third-party investment and facility  development. these agreements expand availability of this nascent technology and  align with delta’s saf goal as a founding member of the first movers coalition.  . m gallons   of saf delivered  ,  mt   of co e avoided used primarily at   airports:   lax, sfo, cdg, lhr, amsin  , delta procured  .  million gallons of saf, a   % increase compared to  . delta is also working closely with customers to  increase demand for saf and help address the  significant price premiums. many of delta’s corporate  customers are motivated by the aggressive scope    targets they have set for their commercial business  travel and cargo emissions. in  , delta had  agreements with   corporate customers, travel  agencies and freight forwarders to help fund and apply  saf toward ghg emissions from their business travel  and cargo shipped on delta.  over the long term, a shift to next-generation saf, such  as power-to-liquid fuels and the ability to blend at more  than  % saf is necessary for long-term efficiencies.  achieving these saf goals will require working with  manufacturers and fuel providers on regulatory  approvals and significant investments in renewable  electricity. these fuels, coupled with the use of direct air  capture of carbon at the saf production facilities, have  the potential to achieve life cycle emissions reductions  beyond the  % maximum

operations carbon council’s   operational improvements as we work to execute and track  operational initiatives that reduce jet  fuel consumption and improve emissions  intensity, delta’s carbon council manages  fuel burn and drives reductions in fuel  consumption through cross-divisional  collaboration. our carbon council is  an established group of senior leaders  overseeing delta’s operational trajectory  to advance fuel efficiency and progress  toward our medium- and long-term  sustainability goals. strategic working groups support  our carbon council to drive further  improvement in fuel efficiency. the working  groups consist of relevant business units,  each chosen for focused collaboration on  specific initiatives. each working group  can spearhead progress in its dedicated  area while identifying and communicating  opportunities and roadblocks to the  executive leadership team.one example of the carbon council’s work  is the decision to install enhanced split- scimitar winglets for drag reduction on the    fleet. delta techops recently finished  a five-and-a-half-year project to equip all    delta  - er aircraft with these  winglets. this aerodynamic enhancement  improves fuel efficiency by reducing lift- induced drag. we expect this investment  to yield an annual fuel savings of   million  gallons for this fleet type alone, with an  incremental  .  million gallons of fuel  to be saved annually from the recently  initiated undertaking of the same project  across the  -  fleet. another example is delta’s active role  with air traffic control (atc) and los  angeles international airport (lax) in  implementing eor in   and  .   eor is an improved instrument approach  system that allows atc to clear aircraft  for landing with shorter flight paths. this  system takes advantage of the faa’s  nextgen airspace modernization initiative  and can shorten flight times by  –  minutes. by reducing overall flight time,  this system drives fuel savings and can  help customers reach their destinations  more quickly. this system could provide  an estimated one million gallons in fuel  savings annually at lax alone once fully  utilized. delta’s carbon council meets quarterly  with the executive leadership team  to guide decision-making and drive  continued progress on fuel reduction  initiatives, focusing on both medium-   and long-term progress toward delta’s   net-zero efforts.carbon council focus areas below is an explanation of our five carbon council focus   areas to reduce fuel consumption, along with previous  examples of their successful implementation:  fixed weight: reducing the permanently installed weight on the  plane (e.g., radial landing gear tires and carbon brakes). variable weight: reducing the boarded weight on the plane   (e.g., reducing the weight of unit load devices like cargo pallets). flying operations: flight routing and planning changes to reduce fuel  burn (e.g., investments in flight planning software and collaboration   with air traffic control regarding establish on required navigation   performance (eor)). additionally, we will continue to seek to  collaborate with governments, airports and others on cross-industry  initiatives. one example of this ongoing collaboration is through the  nextgen advisory committee, which provides independent advice  and recommendations to the faa related to air traffic management. ground operations: investments in ground procedures and  infrastructure to reduce fuel burn while the aircraft is on the ground  (e.g., investments in communications technologies, maintenance pad  electrification, apu ambassadors dedicated to reducing auxiliary  power unit (“apu”) usage while at the gate and partnerships with  innovative companies to accelerate new methods of saving jet fuel  during ground operations). aerodynamic modifications: permanent modifications to aircraft to  improve their aerodynamic performance (e.g., investments in split- scimitar winglets and blade-tip coating research with the u.s. air force).  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix offsets offsets will play a role in compliance with the global  corsia scheme and ultimately achieving net-zero by  . for delta to reach net-zero, out-of-sector solutions will likely complement  fleet, saf, operational initiatives and other in-sector technology improvements.  removal projects that absorb incremental and additional co  from the  atmosphere, such as afforestation and reforestation, or technology, such as  direct air capture and carbon sequestration, will be necessary.  while our primary focus is on decarbonizing aviation and reaching net-zero  by  , we have also supported out-of-sector solutions for many years by  purchasing carbon offsets. deforestation needs to be halted by   to achieve  global climate goals. to further these goals, we continue to support the leaf  (lowering emissions by accelerating forest finance) coalition. this public- private coalition seeks to facilitate significant reductions in ghg emissions  by financing large-scale tropical forest protection through a jurisdictional  approach. leaf works with national and subnational governments to ensure  that all key stakeholders, including indigenous peoples, participate fully and  receive a fair share of the benefits. in  , we purchased and retired $  million of carbon offsets which relate to  a portion of our airline segment's   and first quarter   carbon emissions.   we expect much of the remaining investment to support our goal to spend  $  billion through the end of   toward airline decarbonization focusing on  solutions other than offsets.     in   and q   , delta purchased and retired

accelerate the  transition to a more sustainable and people-first  future for air travel. in  , we continued our  initiative to largely eliminate single-use plastics  onboard our aircraft and introduced new, more  sustainable products. additionally, we diverted    million pounds of waste from the landfill. we  analyzed passenger consumption to understand  what they consumed onboard, allowing our  team to onboard provisions accordingly.  understanding consumption prevents wasted  products and saves fuel through reduced weight  onboard our aircraft. reducing onboard single-use

them in all efforts to resume their programs.  our teams continue working with airports  affected by logistical constraints to recycle at  as many locations as possible. through this  hard work, we are currently recycling at    domestic airports.the power of collaboration in  , delta took part in the sky team alliance’s  sustainable flight challenge to test and explore  sustainability solutions. this initiative brought  partner airlines together to share learnings and  innovations with the common goal of reducing the  industry’s carbon footprint.  on the plane our most fuel-efficient aircraft in service at the time,  the  - er, took off powered by a fuel blend that  included   gallons of saf – marking a record for the  largest amount of saf used on a flight out of atlanta.  gevo supplied the saf for this record-breaking flight  through its partnership with our team. the aircraft included specific features to increase  fuel efficiency and reduce drag, including new  landing gear tires that reduce plane weight by    pounds and winglets. one hundred percent electric ground service  equipment (egse) bookended the atlanta to salt lake  city flight with battery-powered tractors and carts that loaded baggage and fuel. as mentioned in previous  sections, we have invested to achieve a  % egse fleet  by the end of  , aiming for  % by the end of    and a  % eligible egse fleet by  .  in the sky  aboard our record-breaking flight, our customer  experience included receiving soft pillows and  blankets made from recycled plastic bottles.  customers seated in first class selected from  an array of more sustainable menu offerings,  such as meat sourced from ranches that practice  regenerative land management and locally grown  vegetables. first class customers choose their  meals before boarding, preventing wasted food on  the flight. we offered all customers gourmet snacks  served in recyclable packaging.  additionally, customer service used no disposable  plastic, recycled all beverage packaging and composted  food scraps and serviceware in salt lake city. this flight  was zero waste, with the exception of safety, health  and hygiene items that must be single-use. the travel experience (continued) we also seek to source alternatives for certain products from which we cannot eliminate waste.   to evaluate whether the alternatives we are sourcing for our onboard service and beyond represent  a more sustainable option, we utilize a life cycle analysis tool to calculate and compare the ghg  footprint and other environmental metrics of different product types.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix ground support equipment  electrification progress  ground support   equipment (gse) progress to reduce fuel burned by gse that service  aircraft between flights, we set a goal to achieve  a  % egse fleet by the end of   and are  planning for additional investments to achieve  a  % electric fleet (including  % of electric  core eligible gse in   hubs) by the end of    and a  % electric gse fleet in delta’s hubs  by  . delta is replacing internal combustion  engine (gas and diesel) ground support  equipment units with electrically powered  equivalents. electrified products offer improved  sustainability and emissions (zero operating  emissions, low noise and improved operator  air quality), safety (more safety features and  powertrain control), reliability (fewer moving  parts and complexity), technology (foundation  for future investment) and lower operating  costs (reduced maintenance and fuel costs).  delta reviews multiple aspects of implementing  new products, including safety, environmental  impact and responsible supply chains. delta’s current lithium battery strategy focuses  on lithium iron phosphate due to its increased  safety and cobalt-free chemistry.  in  , we retired over   internal  combustion engine units and replaced them  with over   zero-emissions egse units. we  bought baggage tractors and belt loaders (two  largest fleets) and  % of the purchase was  electrified. delta has doubled its electric fleet  since the inaugural   delta esg report  ( % in   to  % in december  ).electrification across     our key hubs as we continue to electrify, the strong internal  collaboration between divisions, including  corporate real estate, government affairs and  airport customer service (acs), has provided the  groundwork for advancing the electrification of  our operations at delta’s hubs. through terminal  redevelopment efforts at lax, lga and slc, we are  adding the charging capacity needed to convert the  core ground fleets (baggage tractors, belt loaders  and aircraft tow tractors) to  % electric. further  investments in bos and sea charging infrastructure  will support  % electrification of the eligible gse  over the next few years. our focus in the new york  city area (supported by the port authority of new  york and new jersey, iat and others) led to the  replacement of over   gas and diesel units and  electric equivalents in  .  adding to the hub-specific wins, we reduced our  off-road diesel emission rate by  % over the last  four years in california.  the purchase and installation of   ground power  units (gpus) and   preconditioned air (pca)  units from a $ . m partnership with the detroit  metropolitan wayne county airport and the wayne  county airport authority is an example of how  collaboration with local airport authorities and  federal programs accelerates efficiencies across  our operations. in electrifying our gates, we aim to  achieve a reduction of apu usage and, as a result,  overall airport emissions.  expansion of egse depends, in part, on  an adequate supply of alternative electric  equipment and airport investment in  charging infrastructure. we will continue  working closely with our business partners  to test, develop and encourage more egse  options. future investment efforts will center  around airports that are egse ready and have  adequate charging capabilities.      % egse by  ,  % by  ,  % by    •  % egse as of december    • over   electric units added in     • retired over

stakeholders,  building coalitions and  driving policy development we recognize many factors surrounding our  climate goals are outside our control and  will require significant capital investment,  government policies and incentives, dedicated  research and development and transformation  of some of the world’s largest industries. two  critical components of advancing and achieving  our climate goals are effective public policy  engagement and stakeholder engagement  across sectors within and outside the aviation  industry to bring cost-effective solutions under  all levers to scale. we have joined coalitions and partnerships  centered around guiding ambitions. we  describe a selection of those partnerships and  coalitions here. our team is advancing other  important initiatives through

informs our approach to climate  and decarbonization. as part of an industry that operates globally and is difficult to  decarbonize, airlines are susceptible to climate-related risks  such as extreme weather and increasing fuel costs. identifying  and understanding those risks and their potential impacts on  our business is an important part of framing our overall climate  strategy in response to an ever-changing climate landscape.  our enterprise risk management framework integrates specific  climate risks into safety and security, operational, strategic,  financial and legal and compliance risk assessments. in  ,  delta conducted a climate scenario analysis to inform further  and strengthen our understanding and management of  potential climate-related risks.process for identifying transition risks  risks arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy, including  policy and legal, technology, market and reputation, may impact  how we do business. to evaluate these risks, we applied three of the  iea’s   world energy outlook (weo) scenarios, including:  ynet-zero emissions by   (nze) that sets out a pathway  to achieve net-zero co  emissions by   and is in line with  limiting temperature increase to no more than  . °c   ysustainable development scenario (sds) that is consistent  with the “well below  °c” goal of the paris agreement while  achieving universal energy access and improving air quality   ystated policies scenario (steps) that reflects current policies  that are already in place, as well as those announced by  governments and under development  we show the emissions trajectory and temperature outcomes  of the three scenarios used in the analysis to project a  particular future state of the world. gdp and population growth  assumptions were held consistent across scenarios. for each  scenario, we evaluated broad cross-cutting policy frameworks,  detailed transport sector policies in regions in which delta  operates and forecasted prices of carbon and crude oil.process for identifying physical risks  the airline industry relies largely on business models  concentrating operations in major airports globally. an extended  interruption or disruption resulting from climate-related events,  such as flooding in connection with rising sea levels at an airport  where we have significant operations could have a material  adverse effect on business. we evaluated   airport locations  –  domestic and   international – strategically important to our  business to better understand our exposure to potential climate- related disruptions. for each location, we conducted a physical  risk assessment to evaluate the risk of flooding and sea level rise,  extreme weather events and increased temperature. the baseline scenario used was rcp  .  (representative  concentration pathway), the perceived worst-case high emissions  scenario where emissions are allowed to exceed cautionary  levels and global temperature rises by about  . °c by  . this  scenario is projected to cause irreversible damage to our planet’s  stability. when projecting an airport location to experience  notable impact from certain physical risks like rcp  . , we used  a lower emissions scenario where the global temperature rises  only by about  . °c by   to evaluate physical risks under a less  dramatic scenario. our physical risk assessment focused on  .climate scenario analysis methodology  the analysis followed the international energy agency (iea) and intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) frameworks to  explore a range of plausible climate scenarios and evaluate potential business implications from transition and physical risks, respectively.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix key

mechanisms could increase the price of aircraft fuel and could significantly impact  our operating costs. we may be exposed to duplicative emissions pricing if a “patchwork” of  international carbon schemes are applied as opposed to a harmonized global approach. an increase in saf mandates in various jurisdictions may result in increased operating costs due  to the saf premium or penalty in cases where saf supply is not sufficient to meet the mandate.  additional regulatory policies governing aircraft emissions in the u.s. or abroad may increase our  compliance costs.medium, longwe monitor emerging regulations to understand potential risks and opportunities. we engage with policymakers and industry associations to advocate for solutions  to decarbonize our industry and advocate for a global approach to addressing ghg  emissions from international aviation. technology our climate goals rely on continued investment in fleet renewal, saf and development of other  technologies that are not commercially available or available at scale today. the cost to transition  to lower emissions technology could result in increased capital investments in technology  deployment, research and development (saf or aircraft) or additional costs to adopt new  technologies.medium, longwe have established sustainability considerations as one of our key core pillars  that guide our fleet strategy and our capital allocation decisions with respect to  the fleet. a commitment to efficiency improvements from fleet renewal is expected  to reduce ghg emissions intensity until new aircraft technologies that will further  reduce emissions are available at scale. we are committed to engaging our stakeholders to help bring alternative fuels  and new technologies to scale for the industry, including through public-private  partnerships, such as the first movers coalition, focused on unlocking solutions for  hard-to-abate sectors. these partnerships and coalitions focus on bringing saf to market faster by  influencing policy developments to support the production of saf.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix risk type potential financial/operational impacttime   horizonmanagement strategies market business air travel could decline or recover at slower rates due to the increased use of alternatives  such as virtual meetings and events. this could result in a decline in revenue. demand for short-haul, regional flights could shift to lower-carbon alternatives such as high-speed  rail in certain regions. although such shifts are not expected to be material to delta, this could also  result in a decline in revenue. in addition to risks from potential changes to environmental regulation and policy, the transition  to lower-carbon technologies, such as saf, or changes in consumer preferences resulting from  a negative perception of the environmental impact of air travel could materially adversely affect  our business and financial results. for example, lower-carbon technologies such as saf and direct  air capture are currently not available at scale and may take decades to develop and the cost to  transition to them could be prohibitively expensive without appropriate government policies and  incentives in place.short,  medium, longwe understand that climate change impacts from air travel are a concern for our  customers, particularly corporate customers, as many are building “return to travel”  programs that have business travel reduction goals in order to meet climate metrics.  we have announced our intention to set ambitious science-based targets to address  our ghg emissions while still providing efficient transport for our customers. we also engage our corporate customers on sustainability by providing emissions  data regarding their travel, along with opportunities to invest in saf together to  address our shared scope   and scope   emissions using an in-sector solution. we believe our proactive climate strategy positions us to be an industry leader in  sustainability to hedge against market shifts in consumer preferences. reputationour reputation among customers could be impacted if we fail to make progress toward and  achieve our ambitious climate goals. not meeting climate goals or not setting aggressive industry  targets may result in customers, investors and ngos seeking more substantial improvements in  the commercial airline sector. these risks could impact delta’s market share and revenue or result  in a shift away from air travel more broadly.medium, longmaintaining our reputation and global brand is critical to our business. we have  announced our intention to set ambitious climate goals and are diligently working  to establish a transition plan to achieve our goals. we intend to reduce emissions  through various levers as described previously. we also plan to continue to transparently communicate our actions and progress

resiliency in our fuel supply chain in the long term.  furthermore, we have identified opportunities to evaluate and analyze the potential impact of climate  change on our business by conducting risk assessments and business impact analysis and integrating the  findings into our risk mitigation strategies to better protect our company.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix environmental compliance the environmental compliance & health teams establish delta’s strategy,  policies and systems to support compliance and implementation of best  management practices to minimize environmental impacts and protect the  health of our employees, customers and the communities we serve.  the programs serve as the environmental foundation of our sustainability efforts.  ythe environmental compliance team provides subject matter expertise and program  oversight for air quality, water quality, waste management and disposal, remediation   of environmental contamination, emergency response and represents delta in  interactions with federal, state and local environmental agencies.  ythe environmental health team provides expertise and program oversight for industrial  hygiene/workplace exposure, chemical management, aircraft drinking water compliance  and represents delta in interactions with government agencies responsible for  environmental, workplace health and safety and certain product regulation   including, for example, osha, epa, food and drug administration (fda) and   the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs).  as our operations continued to increase throughout  , approaching and, in some  cases, surpassing   levels, our environmental metrics remained relatively consistent.  one exception was an increase in the number of environmental releases in  . when  environmental releases occur, the environmental team works across our operating  divisions to ensure prompt notification, thorough response to minimize and mitigate any  environmental impact and investigation with corrective actions to prevent recurrences.compliance management delta continues to use three system tools  to manage our environmental programs,  reduce risk and minimize the impacts   of our operations. delta’s environmental management  system (ems) outlines the overarching  components of our environmental systems  and processes and is modeled after the  iso   framework. the ems manages  and tracks roles, responsibilities and  procedures for compliance with regulations  and implementation of best management  practices on an airport-specific basis. delta’s environmental programs manual  (epm) establishes delta’s policies,  expectations and management protocols  for internal environmental compliance  with federal, state and local regulations  and best management practices that go  beyond compliance. the epm sets forth  environmental training requirements for  employees and provides the forms, tools  and resources to demonstrate compliance  and reduce risk.delta’s environmental management  information system (emis) is a web-based  tool that tracks internal environmental tasks  outlined in the epm. emis provides proactive  notifications to station task owners to stay  ahead of compliance tasks and generates  reports to validate task completion.  introduction safety people environment climate

climate advocacy coordination in  , we accelerated our efforts to build a  more sustainable and people-first future by  leading on climate policy issues. acting on that  commitment, delta created the new role of vice  president, government affairs – sustainability,  based in washington, dc reporting to our global  head of government affairs with a dotted line  to our chief sustainability officer. the new  function reflects a best practice in responsible  climate lobbying by creating a focal point for  leading and coordinating delta’s advocacy  strategies on international, federal, state and  local climate policies. this structure empowers  the entire government affairs function to  strategically and collaboratively advance the  company’s climate goals in coordination with  our business units.climate lobbying principles as part of the highly regulated global aviation industry, we advocate for climate change policies that will help  us achieve our climate goals. this requires concerted efforts to commercialize the nascent saf industry and  support breakthrough innovations in aircraft design. our climate change policy principles provide a foundation  for our advocacy and ensure consistency in our position development process. as a basis for navigating policies  across the global markets, we embrace internationally and nationally harmonized policies to prevent the  inconsistent application of policies that may result in competitive market distortions or send conflicting market  signals. u.s. law, for example, recognizes the need for national consistency in aircraft regulation and preempts  state and local regulation. delta believes climate policy for the aviation industry should also be:  . sector-specific but augmented by  complementary policies to support our broader  sustainability strategy (e.g., electrification of  ground support equipment and operations);  . preventative of revenue diversion for non-aviation  climate mitigation purposes, ensuring we reinvest  any revenue generated into this hard-to-abate  sector and the diverse workforce it supports;  . grounded in science to ensure ghg emissions  reductions are maximized and realized in a  manner designed to minimize increased costs  for travelers;  . performance-based, feedstock- and technology- neutral, recognizing the innovations needed to  decarbonize our sector are not yet commercially  available at scale; . supportive of the long-term capital investment  necessary to sustain multi-decade aviation  infrastructure and equipment commitments;  . rooted in the need for operational safety,  technological feasibility and economic  reasonableness;  . designed to drive efficiency in fleet  procurement, fuel burn and air traffic  operations; and  . designed to incentivize rather than mandate  a zero-carbon trajectory at the lowest cost  (e.g., tax incentives, grants, r&d investment,  voluntary opt-in), as there is no scalable market  where saf can compete on a level playing field  with the on-road fuels market.climate lobbying this section of our esg report highlights our climate lobbying activities in which we  have engaged directly and indirectly through trade associations from january  ,  ,  through december  ,  . this section updates our   climate lobbying report,  released in march   and consistent with that report, includes climate-related  lobbying activities by or on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary monroe energy,  llc (monroe), which operates the trainer refinery and related pipelines and terminal  assets that supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern u.s. consistent with this commitment to  climate policy leadership, we strive for our  coordinated lobbying activities and those of our  membership-based trade associations to jointly  support our climate goals. we constructively  engage with our trade associations on climate  policy and strategically engage with climate  policy thought leaders, such as various  environmental ngos, think tanks and coalitions.  the following sections address our direct and  indirect climate lobbying activities, as well as  certain lobbying activities of monroe, over the  course of   and evaluate areas of actual or  perceived misalignment with our climate goals  and policy principles.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix direct climate lobbying federal in  , the administration and congress advanced the largest  investments in climate change policy in history, putting the united  states on a path to achieve a roughly  % reduction in ghg  emissions by   and setting the stage for strong, incentive- based global leadership. notably, the administration accelerated  its   saf grand challenge commitment by finalizing a  comprehensive saf grand challenge roadmap, outlining a  government-wide strategy for scaling up saf production in the u.s.  and serving as a replicable model for international partners. as part of delta’s advocacy efforts in  , we positively influenced  the federal policy environment through several key efforts targeting  government funding, stakeholder engagement, legislative advocacy  and regulatory implementation. specifically:  . we directly advocated for increased funding and resources  for the multiple federal agencies supporting the saf grand  challenge. for example, we advocated in support of the  federal aviation administration’s (faa) continuous lower  energy emissions and noise (cleen) program and its center  of excellence for alternative jet fuels and environment  (ascent) as well as the department of energy’s (doe)  bioenergy technologies office (beto) to support the  development of saf at commercial scale.  . we also participated in stakeholder engagement with federal  agencies and policymakers to inform the development of the  final roadmap.   . we actively advocated alongside our supply chain and  industry partners to support federal legislation to promote the  development of the saf market via targeted tax incentives and  grants. specifically, we supported the enactment of the saf  provisions in the inflation reduction act (ira) and in its earlier  iterations (e.g., build back better  . ) as well as standalone  policy measures such as the sustainable skies act and the  aviation emissions reduction opportunity (aero) act.   . within the ira, we also supported provisions that will enable  the development of next-generation power to liquids (ptl)  technology, among other breakthroughs – key to achieving  net-zero emissions – including incentives for renewable  electricity, clean hydrogen and carbon capture technologies.  additional policy measures of significance included the first- ever commercial ev credit and new as well as expanded loan  guarantee authorities at doe.  . following the enactment of the ira, we centered our advocacy  around implementation and coordinated with supply chain  and industry partners to file select comments with the u.s. department of treasury and the internal revenue service  (irs), encouraging flexibility in the interpretation of the law  to maximize emissions reductions. we also set our sights on  developing a coordinated advocacy strategy to support future  bipartisan investment in saf policy, given the short-term  nature of the newly enacted saf incentives. state we laid the foundation for long-term engagement on saf policy  deployment and advocated for supportive policies to accelerate  investment in saf production in existing as well as new markets,  with a prioritization on states where our hub operations are located.  in georgia (ga) and minnesota (mn), we fostered foundational  discussions with multiple public and private stakeholders (e.g.,  ga forestry commission, bioeconomy coalition of mn) to  create saf ecosystems and directly influenced the development  of the mn clean fuels standard (cfs) report. we also actively  supported saf incentive legislation in california, new york,  kentucky, illinois and hawaii.    introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix international united nations international civil aviation organization (icao) on the international level,   marked the convening of the  triannual  st assembly of the un’s international civil aviation  organization (icao). the assembly resulted in the adoption of a  long-term aspirational goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions  for international aviation by  , representing one of the only  global sector-specific goals of its kind, as well as the adoption of a  new baseline –  % of   levels – for stabilizing ghg emissions  from international aviation under icao’s carbon offsetting and  reduction scheme for international aviation (corsia).  in partnership with a a and the international air transport  association (iata), we directly supported the long-term goal  and the important role of corsia as the only market-based  measure governing international aviation emissions over a  patchwork of individual or duplicative regulations (e.g., eu ets),  which can be problematic for an international industry. we  also expressed concerns with the final baseline compromise,  advocating to maintain the corsia baseline at  % of    levels for the duration of the program. notably, the new baseline  roughly doubles the costs of the program, potentially diverting  billions in limited resources from preferred in-sector emissions  reduction measures, such as saf, to out-of-sector offsets. moving  forward, we believe it will be important for the united states to encourage the prioritization of saf over offsets, to ensure  structural decarbonization through additional policy supports  and incentives, as well as take appropriate steps to implement  corsia domestically with appropriate safeguards to protect the  competitiveness of the u.s. industry. european union (eu) in the eu, we again coordinated with our trade associations. we  advocated for the eu to adopt incentives for saf development  and deployment, noting that the refuel eu saf mandate  contained in the eu’s fit for   package seeks to drive saf  supply without appropriate incentives to enable cost-effective  investment. also, consistent with our support for harmonized  global policies, we advocated for the exclusion of extra-european  flights under the eu ets to avoid undermining corsia and  potentially adding duplicative charges and obligations for  international aviation emissions.direct climate lobbying (continued) examples of our advocacy include:  yin california, we directly advocated with industry and supply  chain partners – inclusive of a robust media campaign – for  significant budget support for increased saf production as well  as for legislation (ab ) directing the california air resources  board to study and develop a plan for increased saf incentives  in its   scoping plan.   yin illinois, we worked with a coalition of airlines and producers  to successfully advance legislation (hb ) providing a  - year purchasers’ incentive for saf to help offset the state’s jet  fuel tax, which will be implemented in the summer of  .   yin hawaii, we successfully advocated to ensure saf was eligible  for the reinstated renewable fuels production tax credit  (sb ) and worked with our trade association to advance the  enactment of a new low carbon fuel advisory board, inclusive  of a commercial airline board member.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix monroe – direct lobbying at the federal, state and local levels, we also engaged in lobbying activities designed to reduce costs and enhance  options for compliance flexibility associated with monroe’s operation of the trainer refinery. we own monroe as  part of our strategy to mitigate the cost and supply risks associated with jet fuel. however, monroe has experienced  significant economic hardship under the federal renewable fuel standard (rfs) because of a lack of transparency  and other flaws in the renewable identification number (rin) credit scheme under that program, which make  compliance costs prohibitive due to arbitrarily high rins prices. this market failure undermines the larger goals  and objectives of the rfs program. it is inconsistent with the original policy intentions of the program. as such, we  have supported monroe’s efforts to seek policy reform measures to reduce the significant financial impact on the  operation by advocating for transparent policies, such as lower volume requirements that better align with market  supply and demand as well as a rins’ price cap to provide greater pricing stability and eliminate the opaque nature  of the rins market. our advocacy intends to provide monroe with greater financial certainty and economic flexibility  to invest in the business, including investment in advancing its sustainability and climate objectives.  we have also leveraged monroe’s unique vantage point and expertise to inform our engagement with a a and our  value chain partners across the ecosystem to encourage the adoption of regulatory measures that may better incent  saf production. for example, we supported efforts to further update the environmental protection agency’s (epa)  biointermediates rule under the rfs and advance more expedient pathway petition approvals, the lack of which  restricts the saf industry’s growth by preventing the generation of rins for fuel (e.g., co-processed jet fuel) produced  from biocrude or other feedstock materials, among other items. notably, as monroe and other existing fossil fuel  refiners evaluate opportunities for saf deployment in the us, the volatility of the rfs rins market is a major deterrent  to sustained investment in saf by creating significant challenges for companies underwriting the economics of saf  production. additionally, the lower ethanol-equivalency value for most types of saf compared to renewable diesel under  the rfs places saf at a competitive disadvantage in the renewable fuels market. therefore, our monroe-specific climate  advocacy remains aligned with our larger climate goals and objectives as we look to advance policies that will help  catalyze the saf marketplace and help bring monroe into our net-zero vision.indirect climate lobbying in addition to direct lobbying activities, we are members of sector-specific and  multi-sectoral industry trade associations that engage in lobbying on a variety of  matters, including from time to time climate change. included in this section is a  table of those trade associations and a description of our influence and potential  alignment, where applicable, with the associations’ stated climate policy  priorities and any applicable insights from  . we have included all the trade  association memberships disclosed in our separately issued annual political  contributions and activity report that, to our knowledge, engage in lobbying  activities on climate matters. additionally, we have included monroe’s primary  trade association membership in the table.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix international air transport association (iata) about climate change position areas of influence &

also been a vocal proponent for global saf  incentives, key to decarbonizing the industrydelta strongly supports iata’s net-zero goal. we also support  iata’s active involvement in icao to promote harmonized  global standards and international agreement on aviation  emissions as well as complementary policies, such as saf  incentives. iata’s net-zero goal is an important signal to  governments of the industry’s ambition and helped enable  adoption of an ambitious long-term net-zero goal at the    icao assembly.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance

safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix u.s. chamber of commerce about climate change position areas of influence & alignment the u.s. chamber of commerce is the world’s largest business  organization representing the interests of more than   million  businesses of all sizes, sectors and regions.the chamber recognizes that humans are contributing to our  changing climate and that practical, flexible, predictable and  durable policies to address climate change are needed. the  chamber believes an effective climate policy should:  ysupport a market-based approach to accelerate ghg  emissions reductions across the u.s. economy  yleverage the power of business  ymaintain u.s. leadership in climate science  yembrace technology and innovation  yaggressively pursue energy efficiency  ypromote climate resilient infrastructure  ysupport trade in u.s. technologies and products  yencourage international cooperation the chamber actively supported u.s. participation in the paris  agreement and facilitated constructive business engagement  with policymakers during cop .at the end of  , delta withdrew its membership from the  chamber for reasons unrelated to climate or policy matters.  however, delta was a member of the u.s. chamber’s task  force on climate actions, which was established by member  companies seeking to influence the climate policy positioning  of the chamber from within and provides a platform for direct  business engagement with diverse stakeholders influencing  climate policy development. through the task force and in  other forums, delta advocated for climate policies that support  our sectoral interests, such as incentives for saf and related  research and development to support advanced propulsion  systems and next-generation fuels.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix business roundtable (brt) about climate change position areas of influence & alignment brt is an association of chief executive officers  of america’s leading companies working to  promote a thriving u.s. economy and expanded  opportunity for all americans through  public policy. for more than   years, the  membership of brt has applied ceo expertise  to the major issues facing the nation.the brt believes that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world  must work together to limit global temperature rise this century to well below   °c above preindustrial levels, consistent with the paris agreement. the brt also  acknowledges that the intergovernmental panel on climate change’s   report  limiting warming to no more than  . °c compared to preindustrial levels will be  necessary to avoid some of the most severe risks associated with climate change.  the brt supports a goal of reducing net u.s. ghg emissions by at least  % from    levels by  . the brt has developed a suite of principles by which u.s. climate policy should be  guided, including but not limited to the following:  yalign policy goals and ghg emissions reduction targets with science  yincrease global engagement, cooperation and accountability  yprovide adequate transition time and long-term regulatory certainty  yensure that u.s. policies account for international emissions                      reduction programs in  , the brt developed and adopted a “roadmap for u.s. energy policy,” which  includes a list of policy recommendations in response to the war in ukraine and its  impact on global energy markets. the recommendations included, among other  measures, accelerating the clean energy transition and reducing overall energy  demand. during cop , the brt hosted bipartisan conversations to advance global  climate action. delta’s ceo is a member of the brt. in addition, delta  participates in the brt’s climate, environmental and  governance committees at a staff level and leverages the  organization for direct engagement opportunities with  diverse stakeholders influencing climate change policy. this  enables us to provide input into the development of brt  policy position papers and resources. we are appreciative of the brt’s recognition that while a  market-based climate strategy should apply broadly across  the economy, no one policy or approach can fully address  climate change across such a diverse economy and such  diverse sources of ghg emissions. the brt’s formal policy  also notes that in unique circumstances, non-duplicative,  tailored policies may be more effective or administratively  feasible. for example, some emissions sources may face  unique technological challenges or are subject to separate  international agreements to limit emissions, such as corsia.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers (afpm)  about climate change position areas of influence & alignment afpm is the leading trade association representing the fuel and  petrochemical manufacturing and refining industry. its mission includes, educating policymakers, the media and  the public on the value its members and their products provide  the nation and the world as well as providing strategic business  and technical information to its members, among other items.afpm is committed to engaging in the discussion and  development of sound climate change policies. the association  acknowledges climate change is real and is committed to  the development of sound policies that enable its members  to supply the fuel and petrochemicals that growing global  populations and economies need to thrive and to do so in an  environmentally sustainable way. policies addressing climate  change must be:  ybalanced and measured to improve quality of life, ensuring  the long-term economic, energy and environmental needs  of humanity are met  yprotective of u.s. competitiveness and prevent the shifting  of production, jobs and emissions from the united states to  other countries  yharmonized, preemptive and economy-wide  ysimple and transparent  yachievable and flexible to adjust, as necessarymonroe is a dues-paying member of afpm. it has a  representative on afpm’s board of directors (as do all other  members) and on afpm’s executive committee. monroe also  has representatives on issue-specific committees, including  environmental, fuels and government relations. monroe works alongside afpm to advance policies that  mitigate the economic hardship of rfs compliance as well   as a diverse array of matters impacting the overall industry. from a climate change lens, monroe is working with afpm  to increase its thought leadership and engagement on the  role the refining industry can play in the decarbonization of  hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and heavy-duty trucking,  including with respect to the role of saf. as the fuel and  petrochemical industries transition toward more sustainable  fuels and feedstocks, monroe’s engagement in afpm provides  opportunities for delta to send further demand signals for saf  production and to build relationships with prospective saf  producers as well as a platform for monroe to explore potential  saf production pathways.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix analysis we have evaluated the lobbying activities of  the trade associations above for alignment  with our climate goals and policy principles.  we analyzed alignment based on (i) whether the trade  association has a climate position that supports the  achievement of net-zero emissions by   and/ or temperature  goals identified by the intergovernmental panel on climate  change (ipcc) as the scientific underpinning of the paris  agreement and (ii) whether specific trade association climate  lobbying activities were consistent with our climate goals.  the aviation-specific associations in which we are members  have expressed strong support for achieving ghg emissions  reductions in line with science, with both a a and iata having  ambitious net-zero goals. the advocacy efforts of a a and iata are geared toward  advancing government policies and regulations that will support  achieving their climate goals and opposing potential measures  that would be harmful or counterproductive to reaching these  ambitions. thus, they align with our climate goals and principles.  in some cases, approaches may differ yet continue to be aligned  on goals and outcomes. the following are some illustrative  examples which we believe are consistent with our climate goals. . as discussed under our direct international advocacy, corsia  is designed to stabilize international aviation emissions and  is a multilateral, global approach, which is preferred to a  patchwork of regional and jurisdictional approaches that may  result in duplicative measures covering the same emissions.  a a and iata advocated for the continued use of   as  a baseline for calculating offsetting obligations beyond the  pilot phase of corsia to reduce dependence on out-of-sector  offsets and further incentivize and facilitate the use of saf to  help decarbonize aviation operations.   . a a and iata have generally opposed saf mandates that  do not also include incentives that are well-designed to  ensure a sufficient supply of saf at competitive market  prices and avoid competitive distortions. this opposition  reflects the aviation industry’s concern that mandates  alone, without incentives designed to encourage supply and  reasonable pricing, will not support the industry’s ambitious  decarbonization goals. delta, a a and iata have therefore  advocated for the eu to adopt incentives in addition to  mandates to develop the saf market and close the gap  between traditional jet fuel and saf. collectively, we have also  encouraged the adoption of a book-and-claim saf accounting  system as a means of improving the functionality of a  mandated policy for a nascent market by providing greater  supply flexibility.  . additionally, iata has opposed the eu’s power to liquids (ptl)  sub-mandate, which is at an even more nascent stage than  saf. data demonstrate that prematurely requiring ptl could  unintentionally increase emissions in the eu where there is an  insufficient existing renewable energy supply to support green hydrogen in the early years of the program, undermining  the objectives of the mandate. this position aligns with our  principle that climate policy be grounded in science.   . a a and iata have opposed environmental taxes and fees  where the revenue collected goes to national treasuries rather  than aviation climate mitigation efforts, resulting in increased  costs for travelers and the industry without corresponding  benefits for the climate. increased costs to the industry also  reduce the ability of airlines to invest in new and more fuel- efficient aircraft and technologies.  . a a and iata advocate for globally aligned and coordinated  measures to ensure that applicable measures are most  effective and efficient and that airlines do not pay multiple  times for the same ton of emissions. without global  harmonization, a patchwork of regional or national measures  would only serve to increase the administrative burden  and cost for airlines that often operate across multiple  jurisdictions and distract from the sustained investments  required to achieve long-term decarbonization. • relatedly, at the state level through a a, we opposed  efforts by california and hawaii to advance state-specific  regulatory and legislative actions on federal preemption  grounds. notably, we opposed the regulation of aviation  ghg emissions by the california air resources board as  well as the imposition of a state carbon tax on jet fuel  (hb  and sb ). both positions are consistent with  our principle of supporting harmonized national and  international approaches to reducing aircraft emissions.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix  . iata has opposed per-flight emissions disclosures at the national  level due to variance in emissions methodologies by state that  could lead to inconsistent and non-comparable disclosures  and instead urged that any such requirements use a standard  international methodology, which iata is currently developing.     with respect to delta’s non-aviation-specific trade  associations, the u.s. chamber has not specifically taken a  public position on the stated temperature goals identified  by the ipcc, which does not align with delta’s climate goals;  however, the chamber has developed a clear climate change  policy position and actively supported u.s. participation in the  paris agreement while facilitating direct business engagement  during cop . the brt also facilitated business engagement  during cop , and its climate change position indicates  alignment with the stated temperature goals identified by the  ipcc. however, its current   ambition is not a net-zero goal.  • there may be areas of perceived misalignment from the  lobbying activities of these two organizations. for example,  the chamber and brt actively opposed, on tax policy  grounds, the overall inflation reduction act (ira) legislative  package, which contained a variety of climate change-related  provisions, including incentives to support saf development,  which delta actively supported - although we did not take  a position on the non-climate change related provisions  of the broader package. following direct engagement  from member companies, the brt expressed support for  the provisions that incentivized clean energy technology  deployment and the u.s. chamber pointed to its growing  support for bipartisan clean energy policies and expressed  disappointment that the climate and clean energy provisions  were tied to partisan legislation that they could not support. both organizations were ultimately criticized by ngos and other  groups for their positions; however, we do not find their lobbying  activities to be inconsistent, given their analysis extended beyond  the climate policy provisions of the legislation.  with respect to climate lobbying activity undertaken by  our aviation and non-aviation trade associations, a a, brt  and the u.s. chamber filed comments on the securities and  exchange commission’s (sec) climate risk disclosure proposal  noting their support for more transparent and comparable  climate-related disclosures while raising significant concerns  around key provisions of the specific proposal. each association  expressed an intention to work constructively with the sec to  advance a reporting regime that is grounded in the sec’s long- standing concepts of materiality and that advances meaningful,  decision-useful climate-related disclosures without being overly  burdensome, complex or prescriptive. a a, also provided airline- specific contextualization to demonstrate the range of interests  and dynamics impacting our industry. we do not view any of  these comments as inconsistent with our climate policies. as  part of the iterative process, it is essential that trade associations  provide sufficient input to inform this and future rulemakings  governing disclosures.  • relatedly, at the state level, california sought to advance  its own climate risk-disclosure proposal (sb ), which  would have required reporting scope  ,   and   emissions  by corporations with over $  billion in annual revenue. a a  opposed this legislation as duplicative of pending federal and  international disclosure regimes, which is consistent with  our climate policy principle of advancing harmonized policy  approaches that mitigate redundancy.with respect to monroe’s trade association engagement,  afpm has not specifically taken a public position on the stated  temperature goals identified by the ipcc nor actively engaged in  the cop process; however, afpm has developed a climate change  policy position, reflected in the previous table. this lack of clarity  and engagement regarding the science-based temperature goals  has resulted in criticism from ngos and certain other organizations  and is inconsistent with delta’s climate goals. there are also  specific areas with respect to recent lobbying activities, including  afpm’s lack of support for the saf provisions in the ira, where we  disagree. in our assessment, afpm partially took issue with the  bill’s treatment of liquid fuels, expressing concern with a perceived  lack of recognition for their role in advancing a cleaner and  more energy secure future. in contrast, delta actively supported  the saf provisions within the bill as an important first step for  scaling the market while acknowledging areas of improvement  needed to provide investment certainty. while there are areas  of misalignment, monroe’s engagement with afpm has helped  facilitate increased thought leadership and engagement within the  association around the role of saf and other clean fuel solutions for  hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, which is supportive of delta’s  saf goal. additionally, as the operator of an independent refinery,  monroe has utilized its membership in afpm as part of its rfs  compliance and risk mitigation strategy to seek permanent reform  to the rfs program for the reasons explained previously.  however, it is important to note that advocacy is only one element  of monroe’s engagement with afpm. it utilizes its membership  to stay informed on, and to contribute to, best practices in the  industry, covering a variety of issues beyond climate change  including but not limited to safety, environmental stewardship and  operational performance. therefore, we believe the overall benefits  of engagement outweigh the identified concerns.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix engagement is an important  lever of influence ultimately, we continue to believe our participation in diverse and  multi-sector industry organizations, given our ambitious climate  goals, helps positively influence the development and execution  of climate policy positions and advocacy efforts. participation in  industry trade associations facilitates the identification, assessment  and mitigation of risks and maximization of opportunities associated  with emerging policy issues through constructive internal  engagement and external advocacy, as appropriate. with the continued utilization of our climate policy principles, we  are sharing our expectations for climate advocacy with our trade  associations and other stakeholders. while we do not always agree  with the views or tactics of these trade associations, we believe they  provide a valuable opportunity to understand the perspectives of  various industry participants as we develop and evolve our advocacy  strategy. we are committed to engaging in the collaborative  problem-solving process and to working with our industry peers  and other organizations in these political frameworks. where we  disagree with one or more of these trade associations on a matter  tied to our strategy, we have in the past taken, and may in the future  take, independent actions to mitigate any risks an association’s  actions may present to our strategy. as the aviation and fossil fuel industries transition toward  more sustainable climate solutions, delta continues to evaluate  operational pathways for integrating monroe into a net-zero  future – which includes rfs reform – and plans to continue  to evaluate trade association climate policy positions while  advancing opportunities to drive constructive change toward  the advancement of our climate goals. conclusion delta appreciates that many factors surrounding our ambitious  climate goals are outside our control and will require significant  capital investment, government policies and incentives,  dedicated research and development and the transformation  of some of the world’s largest industries. as highlighted in this  section, one critical component of the advancement and ultimate  achievement of our climate goals is effective public policy  engagement, including direct and indirect lobbying activities.  delta remains committed to being a voice of leadership on  climate policy issues, including through trade associations.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community

collaboration with the diversity council  and to look beyond individual priorities to foster an  inclusive workplace for all.  ● employee-led groups (elgs):  meant to create a  community amongst employees while promoting  diversity, inclusion, and fostering relationships, elgs are employee-driven, inclusive for all, and organic. when  you think of the history of southwest airlines, you think of  connectedness, and we encourage employees with similar  interests to engage with the de&i department to create  elgs that enhance a sense of belonging. there were    established elgs at southwest

we proved it. following the  pandemic, we quickly moved to get properly  staffed to restore the network and operation,  going from minimal hiring in early   to  hiring and training more people than ever in  our company’s history. and we did it all while  providing a best-in-class experience for new  employees without relaxing our high training  standards.  in  , we welcomed more than  ,  new employees to  the southwest family. we’ve never hired this many people in  one year in our history—not even when we acquired airtran in   . southwest prepared for the hiring surge through various  initiatives, including scaling our training teams and increasing  class capacity and frequency to support the large volume of  training required.  we also partnered with operational leadership to  accommodate the mass training required for our new ground  operations employees. today, we continue to invest in  technology and process improvements to maintain our edge  in the race for talent while reducing our total time to hire from  date of application to first day as an employee.         southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report people people people performance

providing  a consistent, high-impact onboarding experience across all  workgroups and departments. new hires learn about our  history, company culture, purpose, vision, the southwest  way, hospitality, dei commitments and goals, and other  resources like our recognition programs, perks, and benefits. we understand that onboarding is more than a series  of processes, trainings, and tools. when we listen to our  employees, we often hear that one of the most important  things for a new hire is how they feel welcomed in those  first few weeks. it’s all about our culture of caring. we're a  company that takes care of its people and its communities,  and our people take care of each other.  as we welcomed thousands of southwest employees into  the company, we made new hires feel welcomed, cared for,  and appreciated. we reintroduced our wingmate program, similar to a program unveiled during the airtran integration.  wingmates are southwest employees who reach out to new  hires and welcome them to the southwest family and our  culture. volunteering as a wingmate is an opportunity for  current employees to contribute to our staffing, retention  efforts, and culture.  partnering with teams across the company, we identified ways  to improve our onboarding program to help provide our new  people with the best onboarding experience possible. one of  those opportunities included sending a welcome box to new  employees’ homes that featured a message from southwest  president & ceo bob jordan. similar to a college acceptance  packet, the boxes created a dynamic start to the onboarding  experience. they instantly connected new hires to our culture  and set the tone for what they can expect when they join the  southwest family. we want our people to

experiential, and reflective experiences  for participants through a rigorous curriculum. leaders  receive content in various modalities, including virtual,  in-person, and self-paced opportunities. only leaders  with direct reports can apply for our high impact  programs. our first cohort of the high impact leader  ii program included   diverse leaders representing  various backgrounds, experiences, and departments  within southwest. each participant brought the unique  perspective and skills necessary to lead southwest airlines  into the future.  ● mentorship program:  a six-month formal mentorship  pairing between two southwest employees. after  choosing a focus area, a mentee receives a mentor who can help them grow in that focus. employees at the  company for at least six months can be a mentee, and  all are encouraged to take advantage of this program,  whether their goal is to learn a new skill, explore a  different part of the business, or grow in leadership.  while there are many ways for employees to develop  themselves professionally and personally, mentorship  provides a unique opportunity to learn from one another  and build new relationships. every pairing receives a  mentorship guidebook, extensive internal and external  resources, and support from the mentorship program  team to help create meaningful connections.  from a talent perspective,   was a milestone year. and  despite a difficult labor market, southwest continues to be  selective, hiring only  . % of all applicants.  as the needs of our workforce evolve, we continue to update,  enhance,

proud of the cross- functional teams whose hard work and dedication brought  these new capabilities to life. our focus on mental health   we recognize our employees’ overall wellbeing contributes  to them living fulfilling and productive lives. and we know  mental wellbeing plays an important role. throughout  ,  we focused on providing our employees with important  benefits and resources at no

curalinc healthcare, a mental  health counseling teletherapy service. these benefits begin  on day one of employment, regardless of the type of medical  coverage the employee elects (and even if the employee  declines medical coverage). clearskies also assists employees  with family and caregiving concerns, workplace challenges,  relationship issues, stress and anxiety, and other behavioral  health issues through counseling and specialized services.   this program helps our employees receive the support they  need, wherever and whenever they need it. clearskies also  offer resources such as child care referrals, financial planning,  elder and adult care referrals, identity theft, and legal services.  throughout the year, we also hosted monthly webinars  dedicated to wellbeing, covering mental, physical, and  financial health. we urged employees to tap into these webinars to support their wellbeing and identify additional  resources available to them and their families.  finally, we commemorated world mental health day in  october   to raise awareness about mental health issues  and mobilize our efforts supporting mental health. southwest  used the day as an opportunity to rekindle efforts to protect  and improve mental health and remind employees about  available resources.   embracing neurodiversity in the workplace embracing neurodiversity in the

traits among  individuals. some conditions recognized as neurodivergent  include autism spectrum disorder (asd), attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder (adhd), asperger's syndrome,  dyspraxia, dyslexia, and tourette syndrome. in support of southwest's continued commitment to dei,  the company introduced a campus reach neurodiversity  internship program for eligible part-time and full-time  college students. this program is designed for neurodiverse  individuals with an autism spectrum disorder. we welcomed  our first group of these interns to the southwest family in  the summer of  ,

themselves in  southwest’s campus reach program, receive mentorship,  and discover various career development opportunities  throughout the summer. interns and their leaders also receive  access to a job coach during the internship for additional  support. the campus reach neurodiversity program is part  of a journey to remove barriers that may otherwise limit  neurodiverse individuals from fully showcasing their strengths,  abilities, and potential in the workforce.         southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report people people people performance planet governance

working to address our emissions footprint on the ground.   we remain focused on improving efficiency across our ground  operations, from our aircraft to equipment and facilities.  we continue to make progress in gse electrification. the  equipment most suited for electrification includes bag tugs,  beltloaders, pushbacks, and power stows. as of december   , we’ve electrified   % of all eligible southwest gse,  and at   of our airports, we have electrified over  % of  eligible gse. we plan to continue electrifying commercially  available and operationally feasible equipment. additionally,  there are procedures to use electric ground power and  preconditioned air for aircraft at the gate whenever available,  which reduces the use of auxiliary power units (apu) and  helps avoid additional emissions on the ground. every minute  the apu is off, we save   .   gallons of jet fuel, which adds up  over time. we were recognized by the port of seattle with the    aviation award for greatest airline use of ground power  systems to reduce emissions while docked at seattle-tacoma  international airport (sea) gates. southwest demonstrated a  high use of emission-reducing ground power systems   ( - % of all operations connect to the system), and longest  connectivity to ground power systems while at the gate.  in  , we also rolled out our central monitoring system  (cms) to more airports. our cms streamlines airport ground  operations by enabling us to digitally monitor systems and  equipment such as baggage handling systems, glycol  (deicing) equipment, passenger boarding bridges, as well as  resources like ground power and preconditioned air, in real- time. as of december  , our cms is operational in some  capacity at   airports (   more compared with  ), with  planned expansion

we plan to replace  % of our  total jet fuel consumption with saf, and    was another year of progress toward that goal .   we began utilizing saf in our operations, made  a first-of-its-kind investment for southwest, and  were the first commercial airline to bring saf to  oakland international airport.   saf is fuel produced from non-fossil fuel sources that can  result in lower ghg emissions than conventional jet fuel  on a lifecycle basis. as a fully certified drop-in fuel when  blended with conventional jet fuel in accordance with industry  standards, saf is compatible with existing infrastructure.  because using saf in place of conventional jet fuel has the  potential to reduce lifecycle ghg emissions and doesn’t  require any modifications to infrastructure or aircraft, it’s crucial  to decarbonizing aviation. but we can’t do it on our own. our saf efforts we recognize the saf market faces scaling challenges. the  federal government has set an ambitious goal to scale up  domestic saf production to   billion gallons per year   by  .   replace for context,  .  million gallons of saf were produced in  the u.s. in  . reaching   billion gallons of saf by    would require a  % compound annual growth rate in saf  production between   and  . significant progress is  needed to hit these goals and requires government support  and collaboration across the entire aviation and saf value  chain. progress will depend on governments implementing  or extending policies and incentives (including tax credits)  to reduce the cost or incentivize production of saf; industry  standards, accounting protocols, or other applicable  requirements allowing the company to realize the benefits  from saf (including blend limitations); and other factors  outside of our control. planet        southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines one report people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship while success depends on many factors outside of  southwest’s control, we’re doing our part to help saf scale.  the following are some examples of our saf initiatives and  how southwest helped move the needle in  .  neste we began using saf in our operations in january  . and in  august  , we became the first commercial airline to bring  saf to oakland international airport (oak). the saf used in  oak came from neste, a saf producer we began working with in  . oak is now the third commercial airport in the u.s.  to have saf incorporated into the daily operations of a major  airline.  according to neste, their saf is made from  % renewable  and sustainably sourced waste and residue raw materials, such  as cooking oil and animal waste fat, and it could reduce ghg  emissions by up to  %  over the fuel's lifecycle compared  with using conventional jet fuel. citizenship people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship how saf works feedstock is collected biomass fats, oils, and greasesco/two.dnom from direct air

saf can be made from a variety of feedstocks, both biomass-based and non-biomass based,   using different kinds of technologies known as pathways:  planet        southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines one report people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship saffire in june  , we invested in saffire renewables, llc  (saffire ), a company formed by d max llc (d max), as  part of a doe-backed project to develop and produce scalable  saf. saffire is expected to utilize technology developed at  the doe's national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) to  convert corn stover, a widely available agricultural residue in  the u.s., into renewable ethanol that would then be upgraded  into saf. in  , the doe awarded d max a pilot-scale grant for  saf production, with a goal to scale technology that could  commercialize saf. according to nrel, this could produce  significant quantities of cost-competitive saf that could  provide up to an  % reduction in carbon intensity compared  with conventional jet fuel on a lifecycle basis. for southwest,  this was a first-of-its-kind investment into what we believe  could be potentially game-changing technology that could  help us reach our environmental sustainability goals. velocys as announced in november  , we entered into a    -year offtake agreement with velocys renewables llc  (velocys) for   million gallons of saf. in  , velocys  announced that their proposed facility, bayou fuels, was  re-optimized to improve the expected carbon intensity of  their saf to a negative carbon intensity of  –  gco e/mj  (previously –  gco e/mj) . with this update, according to  velocys, once blended with conventional jet fuel, the saf  could produce the equivalent of  .  billion gallons  of net  zero fuel and avoid   .   million metric tons of co  over the  term of the agreement.  additionally, as part of our offtake  agreement, southwest and velocys established a long-term  strategic relationship, offering us the opportunity to purchase  significant volumes of saf from future velocys facilities.marathon petroleum and phillips   we continue to work with marathon petroleum corporation  and phillips  . in  , we entered into memoranda  of understanding (mou) with these two leading energy  companies. the mous are intended to facilitate the  development and production of commercialized saf.  these collaborations may include a variety of initiatives, for  example, an increased focus on advocating saf policies with  governmental agencies, cooperation to advance research and  development targeted toward greater commercialization of  saf at progressively lower carbon intensities, and partnerships  on initiatives to raise public awareness of saf’s benefits. corporate saf beta program through our saf beta program, our valued corporate  customers played a key part in supporting our use of saf in  our operations. in  , we entered into saf beta agreements  that helped cover a significant portion of the premium over  conventional jet fuel for our saf deliveries.  in  , we also partnered with  air, an aviation sustainability  company providing consulting, documentation, and rating  services, to offer corporate customers in our saf beta  program independently verified assurance for scope    emission reduction rights associated with their support of  the use of saf in southwest’s operations. this partnership  provides an additional layer of transparency for our corporate  customers, helping them track their rights to certain scope    emission reductions. planet        southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines one report people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship our saf policy we developed and published a robust saf policy in   to  help guide our saf efforts. this policy will likely evolve over  time in this dynamic and developing industry.   economics:  we believe in democratizing the skies  through friendly, reliable, and low-cost air travel. to  continue to enable this as we seek to procure saf, saf  must be affordable compared to conventional jet fuel,  but today, saf is significantly more expensive than  conventional jet fuel. when we evaluate opportunities,  the parity of saf to jet a fuel is an important driver.   lifecycle ghg reduction: we require saf to meet a  minimum  % ghg intensity reduction on a lifecycle  basis compared to conventional jet fuel.  sustainability certification: we require saf to  be certified by an industry-accepted sustainability  certification scheme (scs), such as the international  sustainability and carbon certification (iscc) and the  roundtable on sustainable biomaterials (rsb).   exclusions: we won’t procure saf that contains palm  oil and its derivatives or by-products, such as palm fatty  acid distillates. saf must not contribute to deforestation  or forest degradation in its production.   feedstocks:  we encourage the development of  sustainable agriculture for crop-based feedstocks,  prioritize waste and residue and energy or cover crop  feedstocks, and engage in r&d with prospective  producers and

while we recognize that offsets have an  important role to play for our planet, we don’t plan  to use carbon offsets toward our voluntary near- term emissions intensity reduction targets and net  zero goal. future requirements to use offsets for  our international flying as part of corsia or from  other regulatory measures may arise .  in addition,  we may complement other environmental  initiatives with offset projects.   carbon offsets are tradeable rights generated from projects  that reduce, capture, or avoid a certain amount of emissions.  rights can be purchased from those projects to offset an equal amount of carbon emissions from other activities like flying.  we recognize that carbon offsets can be complex and that  there are differing perspectives on what makes a quality offset. planet        southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines one report people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship to that end, we’re excited to

achieve carbon neutrality through an innovation network and  collaboration forum. we’re excited to collaborate with this  innovative group on decarbonizing aviation and advancing  critical science to support that objective. contrail impact task force we joined forces with academic, technology, nonprofit, and  airline partners to launch the contrail impact task force in   . the cross-sector task force was established to explore  the formation and mitigation of condensation trails, or  “contrails,” that might affect the climate impact of some flights.  rocky mountain institute (rmi) and breakthrough energy,  two clean-energy nonprofits, are spearheading the task force,  which met for the first time in october   at southwest’s  corporate campus. we recognize that addressing the potential  impact of contrails is an important step in our industry’s  environmental sustainability journey, and we’re eager to better  understand how each airline’s potential impact may vary based  on its routes and schedule.   ascent in  , we became an advisory member of ascent, the faa  center of excellence for alternative jet fuels and environment,  a coalition of   leading u.s. research

 climate-related risks and opportunities.  planet        southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines one report people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship methodology and scenario analysis to determine our relevant present-day climate-related risks,  our qualitative analysis used current publicly available data  on extreme weather events that occurred in   and    alongside internal stakeholder interviews to understand  what impacts we are seeing today from severe weather  at the regional scale. our operations at times have been  adversely and materially impacted by severe weather,  such as winter storm elliott in december  . for more  information, see the risk factor in our   form  -k   which begins “ the company’s operations have been, and in  the future may again be, materially and adversely disrupted by  extreme weather events. ” an inability to quickly and effectively  restore operations following adverse weather or a localized  disaster or disturbance in a key geography has adversely and  materially impacted, and in the future could again adversely  and materially impact, the company’s business, results of  operations, and financial condition. our qualitative analysis of  potential climate-related impacts to our operations identified  significant short-term exposure risks for winter storms  and tropical storms only. while we are seeing some other  climate-related impacts today, our analysis did not identify  them as significant short-term risks. because these scenarios are subject to a number of assumptions and projections, we  cannot guarantee that this determination will not change or  that we will not experience increased short-term risks related  to our operations.   after we determined present day climate-related risks on a  regional scale, future potential risk exposure in the   and    time horizons were evaluated by projecting how climate  change may accelerate extreme weather impacts under  varying climate scenarios developed by the intergovernmental  panel on climate change (ipcc).                  two ipcc representative concentration pathway (rcp)  scenarios were applied to evaluate our future potential  exposure to physical climate-related risks. this set of  scenarios proposes different, potential climate futures. for  example, rcp .  represents a future with higher greenhouse  gas emissions (ghg) and greater physical impacts from  climate change. in contrast, rcp .  represents a future with  decreasing ghg emissions after the mid-century and reduced  physical impacts

people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship a different set of scenarios [international energy agency  (iea)’s   world energy outlook (weo) net zero by    (nze) scenario and the stated policies (steps) scenario]   were used to evaluate potential climate-related transition  risks and opportunities in the mid- to long-term. together,  these scenarios map out the potential consequences of  different choices for energy use and energy security. the  steps scenario reflects current policy settings, as well as  policy initiatives under development. the nze scenario is a  normative iea scenario that shows a pathway for the global  energy sector to achieve net zero carbon emissions by  ,  with advanced economies reaching net zero carbon emissions  in advance of others.  climate-related transition risks and opportunities may be  greater under this ambitious, rapidly evolving scenario and,  thus, projected impacts to southwest under the nze scenario  may be higher. a quantitative impact analysis wasn’t part of this scope of work.  and given the estimates, assumptions, timelines, and nature  of this qualitative analysis, at this time southwest cannot  accurately

as potential future exposure to acute and chronic physical  climate hazards for each region estimated to result from  climate change in the   and   time horizons. these  forward-looking time horizons are consistent with southwest’s  targets and goals. the physical hazards included coastal  flooding, drought, increasing temperatures, extreme tropical  storms, heat waves, inland flooding,

southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines one report people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship the results from our physical risk assessment helped our  teams better understand what climate hazards could be most  impactful and where we might anticipate those hazards to  occur in the mid- to long-term. for example, rising annual  average temperatures, extreme heat waves, changes in  precipitation patterns, and inland flooding are projected to  affect all southwest regions in both the   and   time  horizons under the rcp .  and rcp .  scenarios.  these climate events could trigger a variety of potential  financial impacts on the company’s operations and supply  chain, including loss of revenue and increased operational  expenditures.  for example, financial losses could occur from  both acute and chronic extreme weather events, which can  cause cancellations, delays, and network disruptions, and over  time, could influence customer desirability of certain leisure  destinations. operating expenses in the form of maintenance  repairs, raised insurance premiums, additional airport fees,  and supply chain disruptions may increase over time to  manage the damage of such events. increasing temperatures  and extreme heat waves pose an additional risk of revenue  loss from restricted capacity associated with aircraft weight  limits to account for the hotter, less dense air at some airports.    physical risk mitigation preparing for future weather events is a significant part of  our physical risk mitigation strategy. for example, we have  procedures and processes in place to manage weather events  as they occur, with tiered response programs based on the  severity of the event. given that our aircraft are mobile,  we are able to plan ahead and move those assets out of a  storm’s pathway as necessary to prevent avoidable physical  damage to our fleet. for weather-related disruptions, such as  winter storms, we continually strive to develop, follow, and  enhance operational processes and business management  procedures for proactive cancellation of flights in an attempt to manage any disruptions to our operations. we also strive  to appropriately staff the operation and determine when to  pause and restart our operations in the affected region.  we engage teams throughout our organization, as necessary,  to prepare for, respond to, and attempt to mitigate impacts  to our business from significant weather events. recognizing  the importance of weather-related planning, we’ve invested  greater resources into meteorology and network impact  analysis, expanding our meteorology staff in   and  growing our focus on weather events.   additionally, we collaborate with a wide range of key  stakeholders, such as the faa and airports, to evolve our  capacity and planning processes. by leveraging various  knowledge bases, expanding data sources, and using new  methods of air traffic management, we’re better equipped  to proactively respond to inclement weather, equipment  outages, and other factors that can cause delays and  cancellations.   we also evaluate and adjust our flight schedules on a regular  basis throughout the year, allowing for greater flexibility to  meet the needs of our customers and adapt to changing  conditions. to mitigate fuel-related disruptions from weather  events, such as floods and hurricanes, we closely monitor the  likelihood of disruptions to fuel supply; work to establish and  broaden our contacts with fuel trucking companies to obtain  priority access to trucks should refinery or pipeline supply  be interrupted; and regularly examine strategic reserves,  including an annual examination in advance of hurricane  season. our efforts to diversify our fuel supply, including the  expansion of saf within our fuel mix, are also intended to  further mitigate such disruptions in the long term. we also  engage in the more hazard-specific risk reduction strategies  detailed in the physical risks table on the following pages.  planet        southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines one report people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship climate-related physical risks exposure to impacts:  low med high potential mid- to long-term impacts risk reduction strategiesshort- term present daymid- term  long- term   coastal floodingacutelarge-scale coastal flood events have the potential to impact transportation  infrastructure (e.g., roads, railroads), which could potentially cause fuel  supply disruptions and impact southwest customers’ and employees’ ability  to arrive at the airport. additionally, these impacts may lead to increases  in southwest’s operating expenses in the form of increased maintenance  or repair costs, insurance premiums, airport fees for repairs or other items,  or capital expenditures to replace damaged or waterlogged infrastructure.  smaller, less-developed airports located in areas exposed to coastal flooding  may struggle to adapt to increased incidences of coastal flood events. see physical risk mitigation  section for our comprehensive strategy,  which is applicable to coastal flooding. drought as the frequency and intensity of drought may increase, the possibility  of water restrictions caused by drought might impact airport and flight  operations. operating expenses may increase under drought conditions,  becoming more frequent as airport lease agreements may require increased  infrastructure enhancements for water conservation or include increased  water use fees. southwest might also experience medium-term to long-term impacts from  tourist destinations becoming less attractive in some areas. for example,  loss of snow in winter at ski destinations could impact revenues.at southwest, we understand the importance of water conservation.  although water consumption is a small part of our operations, it’s  an important natural resource, and we strive to take measures to  conserve water in our facilities and landscaping. the majority of our  water consumption comes from domestic use by our employees, and  we have implemented projects to target conservation in this area to  preserve this natural resource. extreme tropical storms tropical storms can potentially lead to aircraft being grounded for extended  periods, an issue that may be exacerbated due to interruptions in fuel  supply. this could lead to lost revenues due to cancellations and schedule  disruptions in affected areas and knock-on effects through the system.  operating expenses may increase in extreme tropical storm conditions,  with increased fuel expended to divert flights, increased maintenance, and  airport fees as clean-up and infrastructure upgrades may be increasingly  required in affected areas. insurance premiums may also rise over time, or  provide less coverage, with greater frequency and severity of events. for  capital infrastructure, investments may be required to replace hard assets  damaged by extreme storms, and asset values may be impaired due to  potential damage, such as to aircraft. employees may also be impacted by  such storms, which may impact their work availability as well as southwest's  employee support initiatives and costs. in addition to the overarching extreme weather response plan detailed  in the physical risk mitigation story, we also have a program to  help employees directly affected by weather-related events such as  hurricanes, supporting them and getting them back on their feet safely.  specifically, southwest employees may take advantage of a company- supported catastrophic assistance charity, which helps southwest  employees suffering from severe financial hardship resulting from a  catastrophic event in their lives. heat waves heat waves may affect labor productivity, increase cooling costs, and affect  aircraft performance. southwest’s ground crews are on the tarmac for  prolonged periods, potentially leaving them exposed to the effects of heat  waves. potential increases in heat wave incidence, duration, intensity, and  the length of the season may increase cooling costs. tarmac and airplane  repair costs may increase as prolonged exposure to heat may expedite the  usual wear of assets. heat waves may also affect aircraft performance and  could decrease revenues due to reduced flight payloads and more baggage  restrictions necessitated by weight limits imposed by heat. additionally,  related costs may increase, such as fuel. as heat makes the air less dense,  aircraft must exert more thrust to produce enough lift for takeoff. in the long  term, capital investment in new aircraft or parts may be necessary for greater  resilience and greater operational functionality in higher temperatures.to mitigate weather-related risks to our employees, especially those  such as heat impacts, we provide appropriate personal protective  equipment and resources. we have implemented health and safety  procedures and policies, and we monitor compliance with such policies  and evaluate them for relevance. for more information about our  safety program, please refer to the management approach to safety .climate-related physical risks exposure to impacts:  low med high potential mid- to long-term impacts risk reduction strategiesshort-

floodingacuteextreme precipitation might lead to inland flooding and could create  operational challenges for southwest. flooding could damage the airport  runway and infrastructure, making it unsafe for aircraft to take off and  land. this could in turn lead to flight delays and cancellations, impacting  revenues. inland flooding could additionally affect nearby transportation  infrastructure and potentially disrupt fuel supply chains. inland flooding  could impact southwest’s employees' and customers' ability to travel to and  from the airport.we integrate resiliency into our building design plans for owned  ancillary buildings, including hangars, incorporating considerations  of the  -year flood, large hailstorms, and lightning into the design  process. storm systems are designed for  -year flood and buildings  are typically set at a higher elevation to help prevent flooding.  wildfires extreme wildfires can rapidly change conditions such as visibility and wind  speeds that affect air travel. in the event of a spreading wildfire, flights may  either be delayed, re-routed, or canceled entirely depending on the severity  of the wildfire, leading to potential lost revenues and potential knock-on  effects throughout the system. employees working at certain outdoor  locations may be impacted by harmful air quality conditions in the event  of a nearby wildfire. operating expenses may also increase due to wildfire  conditions in the form of increased maintenance costs for aircraft engines  with severe smoke or ash exposure or increased fuel expenses to re-route  around affected areas. aircraft assets damaged by smoke or ash may require  accelerated depreciation, reducing earnings in the year of recognition or  reducing the residual asset value of the damaged aircraft asset.in  , we implemented changes to wildfire monitoring procedures  to require outdoor personnel in certain states to be provided masks  should wildfire smoke become a hazard, based on a parts per million  threshold. those values are monitored locally by ground operations  personnel with assistance and support from the meteorology team.  monitoring occurs across   stations covering california and the  western states. winter storms & cold snaps snowstorms can create multiple challenges to airline operations: the safety  of aircraft, environmental compliance of deicing equipment and wastewater,  which adds operating costs, and disruption to ground transportation and  flights that could lead to lost revenue due to cancellations and schedule  disruptions in affected areas, with potential follow-on effects through the  system. such impacts may also increase operating costs in the form of  premium pay and rerouting of employees to staff the operation. extreme  winter storms and cold snaps can also affect transportation infrastructure  and lead to damage of equipment and supply chain interruptions. aircraft  assets damaged by extreme cold or winter weather, such as hail, may require  accelerated depreciation, reducing earnings in the year of recognition and/ or reducing the residual asset value of the aircraft asset. various capital  investments in order to mitigate risks and impacts from weather-related  events may also become necessary, including as discussed in the next  paragraph regarding winter storm elliot.in late december  , we experienced winter storm elliot. after  this winter weather event, we implemented a plan to increase our  existing winter operational resiliency. this plan includes increasing the  number of available deicing trucks and ground equipment; procuring  additional deicing pads and increasing glycol capacity at key locations;  implementing new weather applications to enhance deicing holdover  times; purchasing and deploying additional engine covers and heaters;  and augmenting winter staffing levels.climate-related physical risks exposure to impacts:  low med high potential mid- to long-term impacts risk

frameworks citizenship chronicincreasing temperatures as the annual average temperature may increase over time in the u.s.,  additional cooling costs might be needed. in some airports, the restriction  on takeoff weight due to hot air might also become a chronic issue that  limits southwest's ability to transport passengers and cargo. reduced  available seat miles and load factors due to decreased payloads might  impact revenues. increased fuel usage and associated costs may be  necessary to gain the same lift in hot conditions, and airport fees may  increase to adapt infrastructure to these chronic weather changes, such  as by extending runway length and resilience to heat. in the longer-term  horizon, capital expenditures may increase to invest in and replace fixed  or other ground assets vulnerable to heat, such as new components more  resilient and operationally suited to higher temperatures.through network planning, we can avoid routing aircraft to areas  that are more prone to takeoff load restrictions during the hottest  times of the day. this provides an opportunity to mitigate such takeoff  restrictions though planning efforts in the long term. additionally, we  can consider changed climate conditions in long-term travel demand  forecasts, especially given the regional scenario analysis conducted  within this scope of work.  changes in precipitation na as extreme precipitation may increase in all regions, this could impact  southwest customers’ and employees’ ability to commute and travel to and  from the airport. it may also cause flight delays. continuous exposure to  extreme precipitation could additionally impact hard assets not designed or  engineered to withstand frequent, intense precipitation, resulting in higher  expenditures in insurance premiums, investments in flood defenses, and  increased airport fees to develop resilience upgrades to mitigate  these impacts.we aim to continue to work alongside the airports and local airport  authorities within our network to address contingency plans and  flood preparedness. in terms of building design, including our owned  ancillary buildings and hangars, storm systems are designed for  - year flood and buildings are typically set at a higher elevation to help  prevent flooding. climate-related transition risks and  opportunities assessment southwest also performed a tcfd-informed qualitative  scenario analysis to identify potential risks and business  opportunities that may arise by transitioning toward a low- carbon economy. the scenario analysis explored a variety  of potential risks, including the potential market impact  of changing customer behavior, the increased cost of raw  materials, policy and legal risks around regulations and  enhanced emissions and climate reporting obligations, as well  as reputation and technology-related risks.  southwest’s climate-related transition risks were generally  the greatest under the nze by   scenario, increasing from  present-day through  . risks that may pose the greatest  potential impact centered around projected impacts of regular  jet fuel and other supply chain raw material inputs, as well as assumptions around the saf market that may not come  to fruition. such risks could impact southwest’s ability to  achieve its climate goals, including carbon emissions intensity  reduction of  % by   and  % by   (as compared with   ),  replacing  % of total jet fuel consumption with saf by   , and net zero by  .    our scenario analysis focused on potential risks and  opportunities that may arise along our path to net zero.   for example, using more fuel-efficient technologies for fleet  operations could reduce our financial exposure to fossil fuel  cost increases and volatility. if southwest can successfully  meet our climate goals and communicate such progress  accordingly, we may attract new customers and generate  additional revenue.  climate-related physical risks exposure to impacts:

less frequently or  fly on an airline they perceive as operating in a manner that’s  more sustainable. customers may increasingly choose to use  alternatives to travel, such as virtual meetings and workspaces.  further development of high-speed rail or autonomous electric  vehicles in markets now served by short-haul flights could  provide passengers with lower-carbon alternatives to flying.  the company’s collateral to secure loans, including in the  form of aircraft, could lose value as customer demand shifts  and economies move to low-carbon alternatives, which may  increase the company’s financing costs. as leisure destinations  such as snow and tropical destinations face greater frequency  and severity of acute and chronic physical events, there may  be a change in demand for leisure travel or destinations of  choice for such travel, potentially reducing revenues in current  markets.we recognize the importance for the aviation industry to address its environmental  impact. as a hard to abate sector, we know there are challenges in achieving this  goal. a truly collaborative journey lies ahead, and southwest remains focused on  doing its part. in  , we proudly announced long-term and near-term goals and  a  -year environmental sustainability plan, all of which we recently refreshed.  throughout  , we’ve taken important steps toward achieving these goals  through, for example, our saf offtake agreements, our first-of-its-kind investment in  saffire, and our fleet modernization and fuel efficiency initiatives. to stay informed of customer expectations, we routinely leverage trip net promoter  surveys, re-evaluate and adjust network plans, and provide products and services  to adjust more rapidly to leisure and business travel demand. for example, we have   launched a carbon offset offer for individual travelers.  we’ve also engaged with  some of our corporate customers on saf beta partnerships that support southwest’s  utilization of available, qualifying saf in its operation. through our saf beta  program, our corporate customers have the opportunity to purchase certain scope    emissions reductions rights. we also launched the green incentive program, a  southwest business performance-based incentive program that provides eligible  corporate customers the opportunity to earn and use funds for their company's  sustainability initiatives. increased cost of raw materials steps operating costs, such as fossil fuel, may be high or increase  over time if global fuel production decreases due to supply  chain disruptions or increased regulations such as carbon  pricing. there may be additional financing costs to hedge  exposure to volatile prices.southwest attempts to manage its risk associated with volatile jet fuel prices by  utilizing over-the-counter fuel derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its future  jet fuel purchases. in addition, we continue to make long-term investments, such as  our fleet

any failure to meet its sustainability  or esg plans or goals, including those that relate to climate  change; (ii) the company’s impact on the environment; or   (iii) public pressure from investors or policy groups to change  southwest’s policies related to the environment. to the extent  that the company is unable to respond timely and appropriately  to negative publicity, southwest’s reputation and brand can be  harmed. damage to our overall reputation and brand could  negatively impact its financial results and require additional  resources for the company to rebuild its reputation. major  financial institutions have begun to announce ghg reduction  targets for their financed activities in the aviation sector. to the  extent that the company's climate targets are not perceived to  align with those of its lenders, the company's access to credit  may be adversely impacted.southwest operates one of the world's most admired and awarded airlines, and we  take pride in our reputation as the airline with heart. famous for an employee-first  corporate culture, southwest maintains an unprecedented record of no involuntary  furloughs or layoffs in its history. our formula for success brought industry-leading  prosperity and   consecutive years of profitability for southwest shareholders  through   (nyse: luv). to address any potential stakeholder concerns, we frequently engage with our  stakeholders regarding our sustainability efforts through investor calls, individual  meetings with corporate customers, financial partner engagements, and through  our communications and outreach. we also measure consumer and employee  sentiment for public posts and press releases related to sustainability published  on our channels, and we utilize a quarterly

sustainability goals, and we’re taking steps toward achieving these goals through  initiatives like saf offtake agreements and fuel efficiency efforts. we’ll continue  to make long-term investments, such as our fleet modernization program, which  improves fuel efficiency and helps us achieve our climate goals. technologysaf value chain steps as southwest’s climate goals are dependent on the scaling of  the saf market, we’re inherently reliant on numerous factors to  achieve these goals, including: the implementation or extension  of saf government incentives and the performance of third- party saf producers. any non-performance of such third parties  or lack of appropriate incentives and infrastructure for saf  could cause the company not to achieve its sustainability goals,  increase the company’s costs associated with meeting such  goals, or adversely impact the company’s reputation or brand.saf plays an important role in our depicted path to net zero by  . by  , we  plan to replace  % of our total jet fuel consumption with saf; however, we cannot  guarantee that our saf efforts will be successful or ultimately allow us to meet our  goal. in  , we invested in saffire renewables, llc. saffire is expected to  utilize technology developed at the department of energy’s national renewable  energy laboratory to convert corn stover, a widely available agricultural

memorandums of understanding with marathon petroleum  corporation and phillips   with the intention to facilitate the development and  production of commercialized saf. additionally, in  , we participated in the saf  blender’s tax credit coalition, a broad partnership of aviation industry stakeholders  who support new long-term tax incentives for saf. ultimately, the coalition achieved  its goals by helping to support the inclusion of important saf tax credit incentives  within the inflation reduction act, which passed in august  . transitioning to lower emissions aircraft technology nze southwest is reliant on max aircraft deliveries from the  boeing company (boeing) to meet our climate goals. with the  emerging focus and advancement of new aircraft technologies,  including electric and hydrogen, there may be opportunities  for investment in the future. such investments could result  in increased operating expenses in the form of research &  development into new fuels and technologies and the potential  for sunk costs if certain technologies aren’t widely accepted,  commercialized, or become obsolete quickly.we plan to continue to modernize our fleet with more fuel-efficient boeing    max aircraft.  the   max, powered by cfm international leap- b engines,  includes design updates such as boeing’s advanced technology winglet, which  results in less drag and further optimizes the   max’s performance, especially on  longer-range flights. as saf is currently recognized as the element that will play the most critical role  in decarbonizing the aviation sector by  , we are focusing our strategy on saf  for the time being. additionally, as a fully certified drop-in fuel when blended with  conventional jet fuel in accordance with industry standards, saf is compatible with  existing infrastructure, making saf lower risk than novel propulsion technologies. we’ve taken action toward our saf goals with our investment in saffire, offtake  agreements

planet governance frameworks citizenship in february  , bob jordan took the reins as  ceo of southwest airlines, succeeding gary kelly,  who assumed his new role as executive chairman.  a long-time southwest executive with broad and  deep experience, bob’s remarkable leadership  has been at the heart of southwest’s success  for decades. combined with support from our  deep bench of talented leaders and thoughtful  succession planning, it came as no surprise that  bob’s first year as ceo set southwest on a course  for future success.  whether it was leading southwest through the acquisition and  integration of airtran airways, the development of the new  southwest.com e-commerce platform, or any of the numerous  transformational projects he’s led, bob has built a track record  for inspiring our teams to achieve big things. bob’s first year as  ceo was no different.  bob jordan’s  first year as ceo bob kicked off his first year as ceo by sharing with employees  his “blueprint for success”—a set of five strategic priorities  designed to set the company’s course for the next five years.  as southwest continued to recover from the pandemic, bob  rallied our teams around the principle of getting back to  basics and leaning on the southwest way values that have  always helped southwest stand apart.  to inspire action and progress, bob and his executive  leadership team aligned our five strategic priorities to key  company focus areas and measurable company goals and  launched a companywide southwest airlines gratitude  (swag) incentive program to recognize our employees  throughout the year for their continuous efforts toward  achieving them. during his first year as ceo, bob led southwest through the  largest hiring sprint in our company’s history. we ended the  year hiring more than  ,  new employees, with the vast  majority hired into operational roles.  governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship and when nearly one-fifth of your workforce is new,  leadership matters. bob worked tirelessly with cross- functional teams to maintain our exceptional standards for  recruitment, hiring, and training. with southwest still emerging from pandemic challenges and  working through the hiring surge, bob’s leadership helped the  company stay laser-focused on our most important asset—our  people. bob prioritized programs designed to make our new  hires felt welcomed to our team. programs like wingmate,  which pair new hires up with experienced southwest  employees, and sending welcome boxes to new hires’  homes made our new employees feel welcomed, cared for,  and appreciated. we also continued to invest in our union- represented employees by working hard to reach contract  agreements. in  , southwest ratified new agreements with  our appearance technicians and customer service employees.  as of march  ,  , we have also ratified new agreements for  our flight instructors, facilities maintenance technicians, and  dispatchers, and we remain focused on closing negotiations  with all open groups as swiftly as possible. southwest also prioritized talent and leadership development  throughout  , investing in initiatives to create and enhance  meaningful learning and development programs to support  our people and their careers. our high impact development  portfolio, mentorship program, and the return of our  leadership summit in   are all strong examples of our  ongoing commitment to the development of our people.   bob’s leadership in getting southwest properly staffed created  a foundation for ongoing improvements in stabilizing and  restoring our network. throughout  , we improved our  schedule quality by adding more depth and more nonstop  flights, adding short-haul flights in business markets, and  more flying across our crew bases. while our efforts toward improving our operations in    are worth celebrating, we must also acknowledge the  operational disruptions that occurred in late december  .  as bob shared with employees and customers, we recognize  the hardships this situation caused so many. following the  disruption, we performed internal reviews and assessments,  and also engaged a third-party global aviation firm, oliver  wyman, for a third-party assessment. we have developed  a tactical action plan to boost operational resiliency and  significantly reduce the likelihood of repeating an event of  that magnitude and impact. we are primarily focused in three areas. our first focus area is improving winter operations,  which focuses on airport infrastructure, equipment, and winter  preparedness. our second focus area is enhancing cross-team  collaboration, which focuses on our processes, decision- making, escalation procedures, and communication during  irregular operations. our third focus area is accelerating other  investments, which includes technology and tools that allow  for greater volume and pace during irregular operations. the  experience reaffirmed our commitment to having the right  people, tools, technology, and processes in place to deliver the  exceptional service our customers have come to expect from  us over the decades .  we remain focused on investing in tools to help us streamline  our operations moving forward. in  , for example, we  implemented electronic shift trading for ground operations  employees and a new hotel booking system to procure hotel  rooms for crew members—all with the goal of making it easier  for our employees to focus on getting the job done. we also  began setting a framework that we believe will enable us to  move to a paperless aircraft turn, which remains a focus in   . together, these efforts helped us gain momentum in  improving our on-time performance (otp), building on our  legendary hospitality, and delivering an unparalleled and  modernized customer and employee experience.  a big part of getting the basics right is keeping costs low so  we can keep fares low. it’s crucial to our business model and  has been part of southwest's dna and our success since day  one. amidst cost inflation and recession concerns, southwest  stayed vigilant about controlling costs, working efficiently, and  taking care of each other and our customers.  bob remains extremely proud of the progress southwest made  getting back to basics in  . perhaps even more important  to him, though, is the way we achieved these things—together.  he often says the best part of his work week is being with our  people, and being invigorated by their enthusiasm, optimism,  and honest feedback. throughout the year, bob visited more  than   locations and dropped in on countless training classes,  new hire breakfasts and lunches, captain upgrade classes,  and many more important company moments. no matter  where he goes or who he talks to, one of the loudest themes  he hears is to be one team supporting each other and serving  our customers. and we see that happening as the business  stabilizes, our results improve, and we continue to invest in  our people. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship in  , ceo bob jordan introduced

employee  engagement, modernizing the employee experience, and  living the southwest way.  ● win more customers and grow revenue by being  where and when customers want to buy and fly and by  modernizing the customer experience.  ● modernize the operation  by giving our exceptional  employees the tools they need to serve our customers— and each other—with our legendary hospitality.   ● maintain our low-cost advantage  through everyday  discipline and tangible efficiency initiatives.   ● be a good citizen  by championing causes that matter  most, including committing to a diverse and

performance planet governance frameworks citizenship focus on people and culture recognition has always been a key part of our world-famous  culture. and in  , we doubled down on the power of  recognition to reinvigorate our culture, retain employees,   and reward great work. throughout the year,  we incentivized  employees to show appreciation to a coheart through  our internal swag employee recognition platform. when  employees are recognized for their great work, they can  receive swag points they can use to redeem for rewards  including rapid rewards® points, gift cards, merchandise, and  more. in  , we surpassed our collective target of sending   ,   acts of recognition per quarter and sent more than    .  million total acts of recognition throughout the year! getting back to our historic operational   reliability and efficiency throughout  , we made significant progress toward  restoring our robust pre-pandemic network and returning  to the historical levels of operational reliability southwest  is known for while maintaining our focus on safety. our  immediate efforts to ramp up hiring and make key operational  improvements contributed greatly toward key goals like  ontime performance.  key operational improvements focused on schedule quality.  this included adding more nonstop flights, adding short-haul  flights in business markets, and flying more across our crew  bases. we also continued to work alongside industry and  governmental partners to address the impact from a large  increase in airspace flow programs in several of our   key locations.  we also continued our ongoing investments in employee- facing technology. we are in the early stages of bringing in a  unified communication tool that will allow flight operations,  inflight operations, dispatch, tech operations, and ground  operations employees to communicate digitally, in real-time,  on a flight-by-flight basis. this is just one of many tools we’re  working to roll out in order to move to more efficient,   digitized operations.  we’re focused on giving our employees and teams the tools  they need to do their jobs, which results in a more efficient  and reliable work experience.restore our customer service advantage in  , we announced our more than $  billion plan over  a five-year period to transform the customer experience,  including plans to

on keeping our airline on time, accommodating  and serving our customers, providing excellent assistance  to customers with disabilities, having a positive attitude  when asked for help, and delivering solid baggage handling.  we truly believe every interaction is an opportunity to  demonstrate our legendary hospitality and create a customer  for life!  return to consistent profitability

business demand helped  drive record quarterly revenues in second, third, and fourth  quarters. as we continue to experience cost inflation, we  remain laser-focused on strategies to protect our low-cost  advantage over the competition. productivity and efficiency  are paramount.  we believe we’re in a strong position for future growth and  achieving our long-term financial goals, which focus on  generating consistent profitability, growing our route network  and revenue, and enhancing shareholder value by generating  consistent returns on invested capital in excess of our  weighted average cost of capital.   governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship looking to   and beyond with our foundational five still serving as our guide, we’ve  recently updated our company focus areas to build on our  momentum in  .  ● live our southwest way values:  focus on “we” before

 staff properly  and show up for each other and our customers. this will  allow us to regain our historic efficiency and productivity.    ● produce strong financial results and improve our low- cost edge:  win customers with heart and hospitality.  that will lead to winning profitability that fuels our future.  as a company, we’re excited about what lies ahead for  southwest! as we move through

industry has historically been volatile and subject  to various operational and financial challenges. successful  identification and mitigation of risks, along with having  appropriate response mechanisms in place to quickly address  rapidly emerging events, are essential for our continued  viability and success in maintaining a resilient brand for our  customers and employees.    southwest’s enterprise risk management (erm) team plays  an important role in managing existing and emerging risks  that are critical to the overall business goals and objectives  of our company. the erm team conducts risk assessments,  produces internal reports, defines risk focus areas, and  provides a framework to drive cross-departmental alignment.  climate-related risks are integrated into this multi-disciplinary companywide erm process. as part of this, the erm team  oversees a tiered risk management structure including risk  champions, comprised of subject matter experts from key  departments, risk owners comprised of senior leaders, and a  risk committee of executive leadership. the erm team meets  with risk champions and risk owners on a quarterly and as  needed basis to identify, evaluate, document, prioritize, and  score risks for impact, vulnerability, likelihood, and velocity.  the erm team and risk champions work together to craft  a risk statement, document other qualifying information,  develop risk reduction plans, and begin tracking the risks and  progress towards mitigation. all risks and mitigation strategies  are tracked, and critical risks are escalated to the risk  committee. the risk committee meets quarterly to review risk  status and mitigation and validate appropriate actions are in  place. the president & ceo has accountability and oversight of  the risk committee and erm function.    in addition to the erm team, the southwest emergency  response and business continuity teams oversee planning  and response initiatives to meet our legal obligations, as well  as our desire to care for those impacted by emergencies.   the emergency response team is responsible for developing  plans, manuals, training, and drills for responses to aircraft  accidents, hurricanes, pandemics, campus emergencies, and  other disruptive events. they conduct debriefs to identify  lessons learned after each response and implements changes  to the response plans. the team also manages and trains the  care team, which is a group of southwest volunteers who  care for those affected by an aircraft accident. the emergency  response team leads an emergency response committee  which includes senior leaders and members from each  response team throughout the company and meets bi- annually to train and share program enhancements.      the business continuity team is responsible for providing  a framework that enables southwest to continue business  during disruptions to its employees, facilities, and technology.  the business continuity team oversees a dedicated corporate  back-up facility, the remote operations center, for key  operating departments during disruptions to the primary  network operations center. the team has  partnerships  with supply chain management on third-party risks, finance  on fuel disruptions, environmental sustainability on climate- related risks, and with technology to prioritize application  recovery based on the needs of the business. a business  continuity steering committee meets biannually to align on  and drive resiliency initiatives. governance        southwest airlines

standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework  to enable data, system, and application security in all areas  of our business. this is a risk-based approach to mitigate  organizational cybersecurity risks and impacts to southwest’s  facilities, airports, and aircraft. the nist cybersecurity  framework helps us understand, manage, and reduce  cybersecurity risks and apply the outputs of the framework  to help inform the cybersecurity agenda. southwest also  has a dedicated cybersecurity team, made up of engineers,  analysts, and leaders, as part of our technology department.  the team maintains our cybersecurity products, processes,  procedures, and operations and conducts vulnerability  management and penetration testing to identify, classify,  prioritize, remediate, and mitigate vulnerabilities. the team  also manages and executes the company’s cybersecurity  incident response plan to prepare for and respond to a  cybersecurity incident. the plan is tested yearly via a tabletop  exercise to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities  for change. vulnerability management, penetration testing,  and cybersecurity incidents are tracked via a platform that  helps our organization meet internal service level   agreement goals.  to stay on top of emerging cyber threats and upcoming cyber  regulations, southwest is proudly a founding member of the  aviation information sharing and analysis center (a-isac)  and a member of the airlines for america cybersecurity  council. we also subscribe to multiple cybersecurity threat  intelligence feeds to monitor the global threat landscape  and apply those learnings to our environment.    our employees play a critical role in maintaining the  security of our systems and data. all employees are  expected to adhere to our cybersecurity policies, which are  outlined in guidelines for employees, our employee policy  handbook, and are acknowledged annually. educating  our employees on cybersecurity doesn’t just stop with our  policy acknowledgments. southwest leverages multiple  communication strategies and channels to interact with and  educate employees. for example, in recognition of national  cybersecurity awareness month in october, southwest  conducts an annual communication campaign to educate  employees on topics like phishing, social engineering,  working securely in a remote environment, and password  security. throughout the year, we also have a regular cadence  of reminders and messaging about the importance   of cybersecurity. data privacy southwest’s business requires us to process, store, and  sometimes share the personal information of our customers,  people, and partners. our privacy program is based on a broad  set of privacy principles and applicable law. while our privacy  office is responsible for the day-to-day management and  oversight of our program, we believe that privacy is everyone’s  responsibility and have approximately   volunteers or  appointed privacy champions embedded throughout the  company that go through additional privacy training. this  training, supported by relevant internal policies and applicable  law, not only educates, but creates broad awareness of the  appropriate standards and controls required throughout  the lifecycle of the data. the privacy champions work with  the privacy office to operationalize the privacy program in a  scalable fashion. southwest offers data privacy training courses  for all employees through southwest airlines university.  employees can enroll in classes such as “privacy at southwest”  and “privacy by design” to learn how to identify or report  potential data privacy incidents and embed privacy controls  throughout the data lifecycle. as part of our implementation  and maintenance of the privacy program, varying elements  of the privacy program are audited by our internal audit  department. the privacy office and the associate general  counsel, information

with many industries, southwest continued to experience  the effects of the pandemic’s global impact on supply chains.  the supply chain ecosystem was disrupted by new and  unforeseen barriers which caused a number of challenges  for our supply chain team. from record-long lead times,  wide-scale shortages of materials, rising commodities prices,  and difficulties in transporting products across countries, our  supply chain team mastered each challenge while partnering  with current and newly identified suppliers.    as southwest ramped up the operation in response to  customer demand in  , demand forecasting added a new  layer of complexity. scarcity in raw materials translated into  cost increases and lower production levels which resulted in  modifications to a few of our onboard customer experience  offerings and employee-related support functions. examples  of shortages we experienced included onboard service  products and employee uniforms. governance        southwest

remain focused on lowering our  overall costs to support the financial strength of southwest,  while balancing the changing environment and needs of   our customers. supply chain responsibility southwest’s vision is to be the world’s most loved, most  efficient, and most profitable airline. this is achieved through  the outstanding work of all our employees to consistently  deliver outstanding hospitality at a low cost to our customers.   in order to keep our costs low, we use a proven strategic sourcing  methodology that includes cross-functional teams to regularly  re-evaluate programs, conduct market research, and facilitate  competitive bidding. we value suppliers who can increase our  productivity and quality while improving our processes and  services. our unique workforce has encouraged innovative  business solutions and leveraged our competitive advantage  to establish southwest airlines as a leader in our industry.  as a company, we value diversity and seek to create an  environment that encourages it, both in the workplace and  among our supplier base. with this in mind, our supplier  diversity program was designed to enable southwest to  extend opportunities to qualified small, small disadvantaged,  hubzone, minority, women, veteran, disabled, and lesbian,  gay, bisexual, and/or transgender businesses (small/diverse  businesses), who in turn can help southwest fulfill its  operational needs, satisfy the expectations of our shareholders  and customers, and meet current and future competitive  business challenges.  we understand the powerful impact southwest has in the  markets we operate, which is why we give from the heart. we  strive to make a positive difference by virtue of our outreach  initiatives and community engagement. our corporate  commitment to supplier diversity outlines the importance  of fostering an environment that moves us forward and  recognizes and values the collaboration of diverse thoughts,  backgrounds, and experiences. as a prime contractor to the  federal government and in partnership with the general  services administration, southwest established annual small  business goals and surpassed each of the six subcategory  goals in  . additionally, in early  , we published our supplier code  of conduct and began integrating sustainability questions in  our request for proposal (rfp) process. these rfp questions  are an important step in engaging with our suppliers on their  sustainability initiatives.as outlined in our procurement policy for employees,  all suppliers are treated fairly and impartially during the  evaluation and selection process. we use more than one  selection process, depending on company requirements and  supply market conditions. each selection process is focused  on the most efficient way to achieve the same results and the  best value combination of quality, reliability, fit for purpose,  and service for southwest at the lowest total cost. compliance  with the policy allows us to spend our money wisely, improve  contract adherence, and protect southwest from undue risk.  in support of connecting people to what’s important in their  lives, we seek to maintain our low-cost leadership through  effective and efficient procurement practices and spending  our valuable capital wisely. public policy, regulation, & transparency legislative and regulatory actions have the potential to  expand or limit southwest’s growth opportunities. in  addition, government policies, including new legislation  and regulations and the enforcement of existing regulations,  can have a profound impact on how we do business. our  governmental affairs department works to stay on top of  proposed statutory and regulatory changes to directly educate  a wide range of policymakers and stakeholder groups. we also  present our views on these topics through trade associations,  business forums, chamber organizations, and interactions  with public officials at the federal level and in the states and  communities we serve.   one trade association in which we participate is airlines for  america (a a), which allows us to gain insight into core issues  for the airline industry and to advocate jointly for regulations  that support a healthy, competitive industry. we also benefit  from the opportunity to share technical expertise and  operational knowledge that leads to improved safety   and security. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet

however, in all cases, that portion was not more  than $ ,   annually for each organization. regarding climate change, our advocacy in this regard is  focused on southwest achieving our goal for net zero carbon  emissions by   and our new   carbon intensity  reduction goal, which is based on scientific models  that are in  alignment with the goals of the paris agreement. whether it  is working through a a or partnering with other stakeholders  who share our climate-related priorities, it is critically  important for southwest to advocate for governmental policies  and programs that will result in southwest flying more fuel- efficiently and using more saf. to achieve net zero carbon  emissions by  , we need the government’s assistance  to enable greater advances related to air traffic control  modernization, new types of aircraft and ground support  equipment, and scaling-up and deploying saf. political contributions southwest has adopted a policy that it will primarily use its  affiliated political action committee, the southwest airlines co.  freedom fund (“freedom fund”), financed by contributions  made voluntarily by employees, to support political  campaigns. company funds are limited to supporting selected  political campaigns at the state and local level in compliance  with the laws of the relevant states and localities.   we hold in high regard the responsibility of managing the  freedom fund and being good stewards of our employees’  hard-earned dollars. we have a time-tested evaluation process  when considering freedom fund contribution requests, and  we evaluate our criteria for giving annually. additionally, the  criteria, as well as all political campaign contributions from the  freedom fund or by the company directly, are approved by  the senior vice president governmental affairs and real estate  and overseen by southwest’s chief legal and regulatory  officer, with an annual summary of those contributions  provided to the southwest board of directors. we intend  for all political contributions to promote company interests  and are not guided by any private political preferences of  any employee. we disclose all contributions by the freedom  fund via publicly available reports filed monthly with the  federal election commission. the company strives to comply  with all applicable federal, state, and local campaign finance  restrictions and disclosure requirements. in  , contributions from the freedom fund totaled  $ ,   to political committees at the federal level and  $ ,   to political committees at the state and local levels.  moreover, the company contributed $ ,   directly to state  and/or local political campaigns in  six states  (california, florida,  hawaii, illinois, maryland, and nevada). in  , the company  did not support or finance any state or local ballot measure  before voters. at the federal level, no company funds were  used to support or finance any political campaign, nor did the  company support or finance any so-called “super pacs” or  any political committees organized under section   of the  internal revenue code. the company made no contributions  to a politically affiliated  (c)( ) organization in  . diversity, equity, & inclusion recognizing, respecting, and valuing differences is at the core  of who we are at southwest and encompasses our approach  to dei. our employees bring their own talents, creativity, and  individuality with them when they come to work each day,  and we foster a culture of caring that values these differences.  since  , belonging

particular  focus in the areas of talent, culture and values, brand and  reputation, and communication. in order to reach our goals  and aspirations, we must allow for vulnerability, engage in  courageous conversations, and listen to our employees,  customers, and communities.    as we continue on this journey to advance dei, we use key  performance indicators (kpis) to track success of these efforts,  such as:    ●employee surveys     ● employee self-id data   ● completion of dei training and education    ● retention, recruiting, and promotion metrics  in september  , southwest

diversity in leadership. additional information  regarding our senior leadership is available in the   dei  report. the dei department formed an executive steering  committee to support the strategic direction of this progress.  additional strides include evolving the company's talent  acquisition processes by requiring diverse candidate slates for  new, open leadership positions (vice presidents

hiring events  we returned to in-person hiring events for select high- volume markets and roles in  . this approach enabled  us to interact with candidates, complete an interview, make  contingent job offers, and begin the initial employment  screening process on the same day. additionally, we  partnered with several nonprofit organizations focused on  dei in historically underrepresented workgroups to attract  great candidates. we sponsored and attended hiring events  [e.g., women in aviation, organization of black aerospace  professionals (obap), etc.] and hosted tour days for pipeline  programs, like obap aerospace career education (ace)  academy, to impact the pipeline of the future. we invest  in recruiting and retention efforts and building pipelines  for future talent to enable continued competitiveness in  the market. after reviewing the various roles available at  southwest, we recognized that many don’t require a college  degree for an employee to be successful. as a result, we  removed “degree preferred” verbiage from some job  requirements. we hope this update encourages anyone with  the right experience to apply for a role at southwest! with sustained competition for available talent, we recognize  the importance of southwest’s compensation and benefits to  attracting and retaining the workforce necessary for continued  business recovery and

associated with the company's  defined contribution plans expensed in  , reflected as a  component of salaries, wages, and benefits, was $  million.   additionally, we provide post-retirement benefits to qualified  retirees in the form of medical and dental coverage.  employees must meet service and age requirements as set  forth by the company, or as specified in collective bargaining  agreements with specific workgroups. employees meeting  these requirements, as defined, may use accrued unused sick  time to pay for medical and dental premiums (or pay them  in cash) from the age of retirement

$   million in  , $  million in  , $  million in  , $   million in  , $  million in  , and $  million for the  next five years thereafter.  regular communications are provided to our employees to  make them aware of and give them access to these resources  throughout the year. from a healthy living and diabetes  management platform to financial education sessions with a  retirement plan counselor to mental health webinars, we offer  a diverse range of options to help our employees thrive.  governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship compensation   we have a commitment to our employees built into our  compensation philosophy, which states that “our people are  our single greatest strength and most enduring long-term  competitive advantage.” to that end, southwest endeavors  to offer fair and market-competitive pay for all employees  that reflects our commitment to dei, recognizes and rewards  performance, and positions our company to successfully  retain our people. in our efforts to honor that commitment, we  put processes in place to routinely evaluate all salary changes  using five basic principles. all compensation decisions for  noncontract employees are assessed through the lens of  these guiding principles:   ●market data that is sourced from reputable third-party  surveys;  ● internal equity, which evaluates pay relative to the pay of  other employees performing similar work;   ● position history of the individual employee;   ● performance of the employee in their role;   ● and budget availability.  applying these basic principles in our compensation   decisions limits room for bias in making these decisions  for the percentage of our population that is not already  covered by cbas. as of december  ,  , approximately   % of our total employee population is covered under cbas  that prescribe compensation for all qualified employees based  generally on seniority, which helps to eliminate any potential  gender (or other protected class) bias in compensation.  for those employees not covered by a cba, the results of  the average salary by paygrade and gender chart indicate  very close parity within the organization between male and  female salaries. by reviewing our noncontract male and  female salaries by grade level, we can closely approximate  a comparison of pay equity at the job level and thereby  determine the correlation of similar pay for similar work. the  average salary by paygrade and gender chart represents  salaries for all noncontract employees, with the exception of  our named executive officers, whose salaries are disclosed  in the proxy statement  and whose salaries are determined by  the board of directors. certain paygrades may have very few  or only one employee within the grade level. as part of our  annual compensation evaluation, we review gender salary  equity on a regular basis.   citizenship people performance planet governance frameworks $-$ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ ,  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g

addition to internal comparisons, we also assess  noncontract employee salary competitiveness with the  external market. when comparing our noncontract average  male employee salaries to the external market midpoint for  male salaries and our noncontract average female employee  salaries to the market midpoint for female salaries, the results  are similar, with variations between the male and female ratios  of approximately  % to the market average. for both male  and female employees, salaries are aligned with the external  market.  the topic of employee compensation and benefits can impact  southwest's employees directly and also can impact external factors through employee spend and participation in the  economy and society. having a stable, well-paid workforce can  positively impact the economies of the communities' where  our employees live and work. famous for an employee-first  corporate culture, southwest maintains an unprecedented  record of no involuntary furloughs or layoffs in its history.   additionally, southwest acknowledges the impact and  importance of employee wellness and is taking steps to  enhance our employee benefits and mental wellness offerings  in the hopes of improving the health and wellbeing of our  workforce.   governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship employee experience, culture, & engagement we believe our culture is truly what sets us apart from the  competition. knowing our culture was impacted during the  pandemic, we had a strong focus in   to reinvigorate our  winning culture and strengthen the employee experience.   a cornerstone of southwest’s culture is captured in our  nine company values, which describe how we show up  as individuals, how we treat each other, and how we work  together for the success of southwest. our values, combined  with our company and employee promises, define the  southwest way.  we actively invest in employee programs and events that  create opportunities for employees to hear from leadership,  connect with each other, and celebrate accomplishments.  southwest has a rich history of hosting employee-focused  events, and in  , we brought back some in-person events  such as southwest rallies (our version of town halls, which  have in-person and virtual options), an annual spirit party,  and a yearly celebration for employees celebrating milestone  anniversaries as southwest employees.  southwest also has culture ambassadors—employees in every  southwest location that champion culture efforts at the local  level—who organize these initiatives. we invest in and support  these ambassadors with dedicated training, communication,  and a platform for idea and resource sharing on an internal  company communication channel. while we can never  guarantee that every employee will have the opportunity to  participate in every event, we hope to reach the maximum  number of employees through a consistent, year-round  cadence of robust programming.  we continually strive to improve the employee experience  by investing in the moments that matter along the employee  journey. in  , our dedicated employee experience (ex)  team refreshed the moments that matter along our employee  journey by adding new moments. we also developed a  dashboard to assess the effectiveness of each moment that  pulls in employee sentiment from employee surveys and   focus groups as well as other people data and   benchmarking studies.   governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship the ex team also manages southwest’s multi-faceted  and ongoing strategy to actively listen to employees and  map the employee journey. we conduct companywide  surveys of our employees throughout the year to assess  employee engagement, job satisfaction, and opportunities  for improvement. in addition to our employee engagement  score (which is comprised of five factors), we also added a  wellbeing score in   based on six wellbeing factors. these  two scores help us measure sentiment and progress. we are  actively adding lifecycle surveys that provide employees the  opportunity to give real-time feedback for key moments all  along their employee journey (e.g., onboarding, offboarding,  etc.). through employee focus groups, we are able to dive  deeper into opportunities for improvement and gauge the  importance to our employees, so we can better prioritize  ideas for our ex roadmap and seek feedback and input directly  from our people. we actively engage with employee forums,  such as our president’s council, diversity council, and culture  ambassadors, which are comprised primarily of frontline  employees. when possible, we involve them early in the  design of new employee-focused programs to help meet the  needs of our diverse and widespread employee population.    in  , we identified several gaps in our new hire  onboarding processes through the feedback mechanisms  that identified a retention risk for new employees during a  large hiring wave as we focused on reaching pre-pandemic  staffing levels to meet travel demand. a cross-functional  team convened to identify efforts and opportunities for  improvement at both the company and individual department  levels. examples of these onboarding enhancements include:    ●a new internal new hire site on our intranet to help new  employees access the most pertinent information and  actions they need to take.    ● a wingmate program to pair new hires with a more  tenured southwest employee to welcome them and help  them in their early days at southwest.   ● enhancement to the new hire now onboarding class to  strengthen content based on new hire feedback.   ● creating a new onboarding experience team to keep  the focus on onboarding as we continue to grow as a  company.  in  , we also invested in a new recognition platform to take  our employee recognition and appreciations to the next level.  employees can earn swag points that they can redeem for  merchandise, gift cards, experiences, charitable contributions, and even rapid rewards points. these points can be earned  through various company programs, including:   ● company goals incentive : at a company level, we  designed a new   company goals incentive program,  establishing a metric and target for each of the five  company goals. each quarter, we rewarded employees  with swag points for each of the five company goals  achieved. as part of this program, we also had several  special swag point appreciations in   to thank  employees for their contributions (e.g., employee  appreciation day, southwest’s birthday, etc.).   ● peer-to-peer programs: we have a strong peer-to-peer  recognition program that enables employees to send a  kick tail (thank you) to their cohearts as well as various  nomination programs for special swag point-based  awards, including our spotlight awards, winning spirit  award, and president’s award.    ● leader-driven program:  in  , we enabled all people  leaders to give on the spot awards to employees,  increased the number of swag points a leader can give,  and added an additional swag point level so leaders  can give more swag points to employees who are going  above and beyond.   within most of these recognition programs, the sender selects  the value the recipient demonstrated, further reinforcing our  company values outlined in the southwest way.   we view ongoing investment in our employee experience as  important because it allows us to more effectively improve our  ability to attract, develop, and retain engaged employees who  will help us achieve southwest’s business objectives. at the  core, we know that our employees are vital to our competitive  advantage and taking care of their needs is important.  southwest’s culture and employee engagement positively  affects the customer experience, which ultimately leads  to a better flying experience that shines a positive light on  the airline industry. our culture has been a priority and a  distinction for decades, and it helps set us apart from other  airlines. the culture at southwest is foundational for our  brand. as we invest in employee engagement, we look to  reinvigorate our winning culture and share the heart of  southwest—with existing employees and with the thousands  of new hires we’ve welcomed to southwest as well. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship employee training, education,   & career development our southwest airlines university (swau), talent &  leadership development (t&ld), flight operations training,  technical operations training, and other operationally  focused departments are passionate about cultivating the  next generation of talent at southwest. as the needs of our  workforce evolve, we continue to update, enhance, and create  meaningful training, programs, practices, and more to support  our people. we regularly evaluate the skill sets needed by our  employees to stay competitive in an ever-changing, highly  regulated environment. in addition, our training teams strive  to offer employees the most effective and efficient learning  solutions while focusing on compliance. these efforts start  with initial training, which focuses on safety and operational  proficiency; to recurrent training, designed to refresh and  update employee skills throughout their career; to leadership  training, equipping new and seasoned leaders with the tools  and competencies to build great teams; while also offering  optional learning opportunities for employees to supplement  their development. through various training and curriculum  options such as classroom training, distance learning, on-the- job training, mentoring, and blended learning, we empower  employees to create a career that fits their goals and lifestyle.  new southwest employees receive most of their training at  our corporate campus in dallas, texas. employees start the  day with a celebratory welcome as they walk the red carpet  during their onboarding class. afterwards, employees spend  the day learning about our history, company culture, benefits,  and more. in  , we continued offering self-paced, virtual,  and in-person learning options to make learning available to  more employees. we’ve also updated the southwest learning  center to provide leaders and employees with a clean, simple  catalog of virtual training opportunities—addressing required  training needs and optional curriculum. additionally, we  introduced an enterprise-wide mentorship program available  to all employees regardless of their job titles. this program  enables employees to develop themselves professionally  and personally by learning from one another and building  new relationships within the southwest family. in  , we  matched approximately   mentor/mentee pairs in the fall  cycle of the mentorship program.  in  , we launched several new development opportunities  for leaders, including an initial leadership development  program to train new leaders, a continuous development  program for existing leaders, and an immersive leadership  program to grow high-impact leaders at the manager/ senior manager level. each program focuses on leadership  competencies, dei, business acumen, and other leadership  skills to develop dynamic and successful leaders at southwest. we’ve also continued to provide resources through our career  mobility center, a centralized resource for our employees to  learn about the skills, experiences, and education needed for  their next career step at southwest. career mobility allows  employees to meet with career mobility coaches who can  direct them to relevant classes, temporary opportunities, or  interview preparation techniques to increase diversity and  vertical and lateral mobility for all southwest employees. since  the launch of career mobility in  , we’ve conducted more  than  ,   career mobility appointments with more than  ,    unique employees. our most popular appointment types are  career advising and interview preparation with  ,   and   ,   appointments conducted respectively in  . while  career mobility is available to all departments and employee  levels, most of our appointment demand comes from various  operational workgroups. it’s all about a career with heart   and purpose.  beginning in  , southwest airlines partnered with gallup®  to launch cliftonstrengths, where employees discover their  strengths and empower others to develop theirs. as of  december  ,  , all departments in the organization are  participating in cliftonstrengths in some manner.  southwest believes our focus on diversity and inclusion  training enables enhanced teamwork and innovation. in   , we continued our partnership with mind gym to  utilize their fearlessly authentic curriculum, which supports  our commitment to foster an inclusive environment where  employees embrace differences and feel a sense of belonging.  in  , southwest offered additional development for all  leaders around inclusive leadership and how to build a  diverse and inclusive workforce. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship freedom of association & collective  bargaining  at southwest, we respect the legal rights of our employees,  including the right to free association and collective  bargaining. approximately  % of our workforce is  represented by labor unions (as of december  ,  ). the  railway labor act (rla) establishes the right of our employees  to organize and bargain collectively. our approach to  collective bargaining focuses on negotiating agreements that  achieve positive outcomes for our people and company. for  example, in  , southwest ratified new agreements with our  appearance technicians and customer service employees.  as of march  ,  , we’ve also ratified new agreements for  our flight instructors, facilities maintenance technicians, and  dispatchers, and we remain focused on closing negotiations  with all open groups as swiftly as possible.   airlines’ collective bargaining agreements are governed by  the rla, which protects the right of employees to organize  and bargain collectively. under the rla, a collective  bargaining agreement does not expire, but instead becomes  amendable on a certain date. in  , we continued  traditional negotiations after the pandemic environment  waned, and we remain committed to reaching agreements  with our union partners in a timely manner. senior leadership  regularly receives updates on progress in negotiations, and  implementation schedules are put in place for changes when  a new agreement is reached.  the rla requires an airline and the union to negotiate and  to “exert every reasonable effort” to reach agreement. in the  event the parties are unable to reach an agreement, either one  or both parties may request the national mediation board’s  (nmb’s) mediation services. during this time, there is a long  process that must be followed before the parties could be  released from mediation and consider “self-help,” which could  include strikes by labor or implementation of management’s  proposals. since  ,  % of mediation cases overseen by  the nmb resulted in an agreement.  our annual report on form  -k contains more information  on the various unions representing our employees. the  company reviews its approach to collective bargaining on an  ongoing basis, and as outlined in the annual report on form   -k, collective bargaining agreements are reviewed and  renegotiated periodically. human rights & anti-trafficking  southwest airlines is committed to doing the right thing to  protect and promote human rights in every aspect of our  business as outlined in the company’s human rights policy  statement. by complying with applicable laws and establishing  and upholding appropriate policies, we seek to help guard  against any potential human rights abuse. we regularly  evaluate our approach to human rights and assess our impact  in all aspects of our business. our commitment to human  rights can be seen through various initiatives, including  our diverse recruitment efforts, robust employee training,  commitment to hospitality and civility (both internally and  externally), dedication to an ethical supply chain, and support  of community organizations.  at southwest, we provide a stable work environment that  offers equal opportunity for personal and professional  growth. more than half of southwest employees received  human rights training in  . it is expected that our  employees act responsibly to maintain a positive working  environment, allowing each employee to perform at their  maximum potential. we encourage all employees to bring  any questions or concerns regarding harassment, sexual  harassment, discrimination, or retaliation to their leaders or  to the employee relations team. all inquiries are reviewed  and addressed by the employee relations team promptly,  impartially, and discreetly under southwest airlines policy  concerning harassment, sexual harassment, discrimination,  & retaliation. our commitment to non-discrimination and  human rights principles is evident in our human rights policy  and the way we carry out our purpose, our vision, and   our values.   overall, our approach to human rights is designed to align  with international standards, including the un guiding  principles for business and human rights, the international  bill of human rights, and the international labor organization  (ilo) declaration on fundamental principles and rights at  work. by regularly evaluating and addressing our impact on  human rights, we aim to promote a positive and   responsible

chamber,  greater baltimore committee, downtown denver inc., dallas  regional chamber, hawaii visitors and convention bureau,  los angeles area chamber of commerce, greater houston  partnership, and florida economic development council.     through our community outreach efforts, we focus on  our pillars of loving people, building resilience, and living  responsibly, to uniquely contribute to communities we serve  in meaningful ways. our partnerships and programs in human  trafficking awareness, dei, disaster and crisis response,  environmental sustainability, life-changing transportation, and  workforce development support our desire to drive economic,  social, and environmental benefits across the southwest  system and beyond. we steward our resources to help communities thrive where  our customers and employees live and work. our social  responsibility approach advances the southwest business and  drives our mission to be a trusted global citizen by connecting  people and championing communities.   the southwest airlines foundation, a corporate-advised fund,  is an extension of our corporate commitment to social impact  and community resilience. the purpose of any foundation is to  create a permanent trust where corporate charitable donations  can be preserved and invested for future use. the southwest  airlines foundation’s mission is to affect meaningful change  by investing in transformational programs and initiatives that  promote equity, prosperity, and sustainability. for example, southwest supports two scholarship programs. through the  southwest airlines scholarship we seek to build a diverse  talent pipeline, while inspiring future generations to find  careers within the airline industry; and the herbert d. kelleher  and rollin w. king scholarship was established for eligible  dependents of southwest airlines employees to pursue  higher education. we also remain diligent in monitoring  emerging societal issues and topics. our response to these  circumstances is based on a number of factors, including the  potential impact on our employees, brand and reputation,  business operations, communities, and customers.   internally, southwest’s employees highly value the opportunity  to give back. southwest has offered internal incentives to  encourage employees to log their volunteer hours, aligning  with our heart for service. and, we have a matching program  where nonprofits earn tickets in-kind for employee volunteer  efforts as well.  we regularly review our annual community contributions  and continue to evaluate their effectiveness through impact  reports and ongoing touchpoints with key partners and  stakeholders. as well, we continuously solicit reports and  metrics from our partners, and enhance our own reporting  process to further refine our overall citizenship progress   and results.   southwest’s impact on the community is quite vast because  we seek to serve as a hometown carrier for the

and operations.  climate-related risk types recommended by the tcfd have  been included in the   climate-related physical and  transition risk and opportunity assessment. specifically, this  includes current and emerging regulations, legal, technology,  market, reputation, as well as physical risks—both acute   and chronic.   the results from both the climate-related physical and  transition risk and opportunity assessment show that we  may experience impacts in the future if we do not mitigate  or manage these risks, increase our adaptive capacity, and  enhance our organization’s resilience to climate change. in  response, we are working to enhance our organizational  resilience to climate change through our operations and  our engagement with employees and community members.  we also engage with many partners that help us further  sustainability efforts around the country. please refer to the  mitigating climate risk  story for more information on our  climate-related risks and

operating cost, approximately  % of operating  expenses in  .  airlines are inherently dependent on energy to operate, with  jet fuel being one of the most volatile and unpredictable  costs. this makes it an area of interest for our stakeholders.  although the price of fuel is largely influenced by external  factors, we can still make an impact by striving for greater fuel  efficiency. because fuel management is integrated into various  work streams, we have a dedicated cross-functional working  group, our fuel design team, made up of individuals across  multiple aspects of the business that identify opportunities  to increase efficiency across work streams without impacting  safety or hospitality. this team implements, tracks, and  reports progress on various fuel saving measures, seeking  to increase alignment across the operation and improve fuel  efficiency. we maintain detailed records of our actual jet fuel  and ground fuel consumption per station for all scheduled and  unscheduled flights. for additional information on our fuel  efficiency initiatives, please reference our reduce  story in the  planet section.   greenhouse gas emissions  effectively tracking and managing the mitigation of ghgs  associated with our business is core to effective climate risk  management. to this end, we’ve publicly reported on our  emissions annually since  , bringing more than   years of  monitoring and insight into the ghg impact of our operations.  southwest follows the greenhouse gas protocol: a corporate  accounting and reporting standard (ghg protocol) guidance  to collect activity data and calculate emissions. our    greenhouse gas inventory was assessed by a third-party and  completed in accordance with the aa  assurance standard  (assurance statement for   greenhouse gas inventory ).  this assurance engagement included our scope  , scope  ,  and certain scope   ghg emissions.   southwest follows the operational control approach  defined by the ghg protocol, accounting for emissions  from operations over which we have complete authority to  apply operating practices. we calculate and incorporate the  relevant carbon dioxide (co ), methane (ch ), and nitrous  oxide (n o) emissions from our operations. emissions are  consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide  equivalent (co e) using the  -year time horizon global  warming potential (gwp) values from the intergovernmental  panel on climate change (ipcc) fifth assessment report  (ar ). hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs), perfluorocarbons (pfcs),  nitrogen trifluoride (nf ), and sulfur hexafluoride (sf ) were  found to be de minimis, and therefore not reported in  association with our operations.   governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship more than  % of southwest’s scope   emissions are from  jet fuel, which is why addressing fuel is imperative to our  mitigation plans. our remaining < % of scope   emissions is  largely from ground fuel use in the form of gasoline, diesel,  and propane, as well as natural gas for heating. all scope    emissions were calculated with epa emission factors except  for jet fuel,  which used icao’s emission factors, and cng  (compressed natural gas) emissions, which used the climate  registry’s factors. scope   indirect electricity emissions were  calculated using epa’s egrid factors by subregion. additionally,  in   we included market-based scope   indirect electricity  emissions in the planet data table for the first time. previously,  we reported the scope   emissions that cover emissions from  waste generated in operations and employee commuting.  in  , we also expanded our scope   reporting to include  purchased goods and services, capital goods, and fuel and  energy-related activities. to manage our scope   and   emissions, we have set forth a  framework of voluntary interim and long-term goals, actions,  and initiatives. in  , we updated our carbon intensity  goal to the following: reduce our lifecycle carbon emissions  per revenue ton kilometer by  % by   and  % by    as compared

a a partners across the industry  in concerted work with government leaders toward this aim,  recognizing that there is much work to be done, and we  are focused on doing our part. in parallel with our efforts to  address our environmental impact, we are also engaged in  long-term policy objectives through a a which are aimed at  advancing and deploying commercially viable technology,  operations, and infrastructure for saf—all of which are  required to enable the industry transition toward net zero. environmental compliance maintaining compliance with local, state, and federal  environmental laws and regulations is fundamental to our  environmental policy. we continually work to meet our  annual goal of zero recorded environmental violations. our  environmental services team regularly conducts audits to  review compliance. we also work to improve our performance by utilizing our environmental management system (ems),  following environmental guidelines and procedures,  implementing corrective action, and training our employees  to meet our compliance goals. on a regular basis, we meet  with our airport stakeholders both in response to events and  incidents (if any), as well as to foster a collaborative approach  to our collective compliance. our standard auditing protocol assesses a location’s  recordkeeping permit status, and compliance with  requirements of regulatory plans such as storm water  pollution prevention plans, spill prevention control, and  countermeasure plans. we perform a visual walk-through  inspection to confirm that key compliance practices are  enacted in each of the cities we serve. at all our locations,  we also track spills, audit findings and corresponding  corrective action, and information about permits and their  expiration dates. we set goals and use our ems and chemical  management system (cms) to aid in our effort to maintain  compliance with environmental regulations, minimize  costs and risk, and measure our efforts to improve our  environmental performance.    we also track environmental issues that may have an impact  to the broader aviation industry, such as the increased  focus of governmental agencies on per- and polyfluoroalkyl  substances (pfas). pfas are a key component in aqueous film- forming foam (afff), which is widely used to fight petroleum- based fires at both commercial and military aviation facilities.  the faa and the u.s. department of defense have strict  performance specifications for fire suppression systems, which  has contributed to the use of afff/pfas over the decades.  pfas is now the focus of regulatory oversight at airports,  as well as the source of litigation by airports against afff  manufacturers. moreover, regulatory authorities at the federal,  state, and local levels are contemplating both the prohibition  of pfas-based afff and costly remediation efforts at airports  to address groundwater contamination. southwest actively  monitors the

evaluate and explore ongoing  opportunities to embed sustainability into our   facility operations.   we are also actively assessing energy efficiency, water  conservation, and construction practices at southwest. we are  mindful of the impact of our facilities on the environment, and  we have taken action to address those impacts. here are a few  steps southwest is taking:   ●evaluating and exploring efforts to integrate energy  conscious considerations into our facilities standards,  including developing an energy roadmap that may include  facility-level sustainability goals.   ● finding opportunities to build efficiently and to obtain  leed certifications during construction when appropriate.    ● participating in energy mitigation events to save energy  and support our

addition, we educate and engage our employees about our  internal recycling practices and share recycling tips they can  use at work and at home. for additional information on waste  generation, please refer to the planet data table . water at southwest, we understand the importance of water  conservation. although our water consumption is minimal in  comparison to our total environmental impact, we work with  certain airports throughout our network to control storm water  runoff and mitigate environmental impacts to nearby bodies  of water.  storm water effluent from airports is regulated under the  epa’s national pollutant discharge elimination system  (npdes) program. permits are issued to each airport or to  individual airlines operating at an airport under the npdes  program so that aircraft deicing fluid runoff and fluids used  to maintain aircraft and equipment are properly managed to  prevent adverse impacts to the environment. we work with  the airports we serve to take measures to address runoff  related to aircraft deicing, including aircraft deicing fluid  recovery and other related pollution-reduction technologies.  as well, we support storm water management efforts by  maintaining compliance with regulatory plans, such as  storm water pollution prevention plans (swppp) and spill  prevention, control, and countermeasure plans (spcc), and  by including the topic of storm water protection in our annual  environmental training required for all our operational groups.   although water consumption is a small part of our operations,  it is an important natural resource, and we strive to take  measures to conserve water in our facilities and landscaping.  the majority of our water consumption comes from domestic  use by our employees, and we have implemented projects to  target conservation in this area in order to preserve this   natural resource. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship safety southwest airlines’ operational philosophy defines key  principles and expectations for frontline employees. most  importantly, and without compromise, we put safety first.  employees are expected to follow company policies and  procedures designed to enable operations at an acceptable  level of risk for southwest in compliance with regulatory  requirements. next, and only after operating safely, we  balance being low-cost and reliable, all delivered with world- class hospitality. the operational philosophy provides a  framework to offer employees a safe work environment, our  customers a safe travel experience, and, in turn, position  southwest airlines for success. this operational philosophy  positively impacts our customers and employees and helps to  mitigate potential, negative impacts of the operation.  at southwest, our commitment to safety is embodied in our  safety management system (sms), which establishes the  framework that enables southwest to operate safely. the sms  framework is comprised of four main components: safety  policy, safety risk management, safety assurance, and safety  promotion. these components are seamlessly integrated into  all of our processes, establishing a robust structure for safety  at southwest. southwest’s safety policy is reflected in our safety and security  commitment, which is a public pledge made by all southwest  employees and senior leadership to the safety and security of  our customers and employees. it establishes clear company  and employee expectations for safety and security and holds  our employees accountable for meeting these expectations.  southwest’s safety policy also covers our safety and security  objectives, including safety objectives specific to supporting  employees and reducing injuries. southwest employees are  expected to demonstrate their commitment to safety by:    ●following company policies and procedures    ●identifying anything that could cause damage or injury    ●reporting hazards through companywide reporting tools    ●knowing and understanding our safety and security  commitment    our operational processes incorporate participation from  employees to help identify, develop, and implement  procedural changes, including those specific to mitigating  hazards (anything that could cause injury or damage) or  negative impacts. being accountable to the safety and security  commitment is yet another way that our employees offer our  customers the hospitality we’re known for—through the lens  of a safe operation. citizenship people performance planet governance frameworks operational philosophy operational philosophy the safety risk management function of our sms provides  a proactive, systemic, and standardized process designed  to identify hazards and risks to the operation and workplace  before they become injuries, accidents, or incidents. it is  designed to mitigate risk through the implementation of  effective risk controls, including tools, technology, and  training. one example of our commitment to safety is the  implementation of fire containment bags on all of our aircraft.  with the increasing use of electronic devices that contain  rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, there’s a growing risk of  overheating and fire. to address this issue, southwest invested  in fire containment bags that are designed to contain and  extinguish any potential fires. these bags play a critical role  in our efforts to mitigate the level of risk and maintain the  highest level of safety for our customers and employees. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship all areas of the sms receive companywide and department- specific safety promotion support, which includes both  training and communication related to safety. southwest  developed specific job function training built around  comprehensive standards intended to provide employees  the skills they need to operate safely. we also have a robust  engagement strategy to promote and educate stakeholders  regarding the company’s safety and security commitment.  it includes communication at the enterprise level through  a variety of channels, targeted communication to frontline  employees with safety messaging refined to their areas of  risk, and leadership communication that identifies trends and  provides talking points for leaders to share areas of concern or  improvement. leaders are also able to access results for their  specific location and workgroup to determine what their focus  areas should be to improve results moving forward. sms is  designed to create and foster a strong safety culture through  knowledge and understanding. our comprehensive approach  supports our commitment to making safety a top priority.the safety assurance function of the sms relies on data  and analytics to continuously measure and analyze the  effectiveness of risk controls and overall safety performance.  southwest monitors safety performance using a variety of  data including employee reporting, aircraft information,  safety investigations, fatigue programs, and audits. audit data  is specifically used to proactively evaluate the effectiveness  of safety risk controls. we proactively look for things that  can cause injury or damage when we implement a new or  changed policy or procedure. we also monitor safety risk  controls through assurance systems. not only do we look at  recent controls implemented, but we are always continuously  monitoring controls that have been in our systems for an  extended period of time. we use our assurance programs to  look at control effectiveness across all operational processes;  when we have indications that are not what we expect, we do  further analysis and have formalized the system assessment  process to document decisions and fixes when the safety  performance is not acceptable. in  , we conducted more  than   system assessments. for example, a recent change  identified through data was an enhancement to the safety  features of our provisioning trucks. we implemented a fall  mitigation for our provisioning agents by using an engineered  control to prevent the back curtain of the provisioning truck  from being open while the back of the truck is raised. a fall  from the height of a raised truck could cause serious injury, so  implementing the fix reduces that level of risk and enhances  employee safety. we also conduct further analysis when  something we are monitoring is performing really well and  look for opportunities to implement similar concepts or ideas  in current or upcoming projects. one example of this is our  very successful etops (extended operations) program. we  implemented etops post-sms, so it required us to conduct  safety risk management. as we built our processes, we  proactively identified hazards and developed risk controls to  manage the risk prior to operating any etops flight. as an  added benefit, this provided the ability to also build in robust  assurance. as we implemented safety risk controls, we knew  what data we needed to collect and developed areas to use  automation to assist in continuous monitoring. each area we  monitor has defined metrics, which are regularly reviewed and  presented to the etops advisory board. as well, we regularly evaluate our performance against safety  objectives which include reducing injuries and damage in the  operation. during the past couple of years, with significant  changes to the operational environment, we were able to  use data to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of our  risk controls and target areas to improve performance. we  monitored the changes supporting the restoration of the  operation post covid-  and onboarding thousands of new  employees with excellent results; our employees demonstrate  a commitment to keeping each other and our customers safe.   citizenship people performance planet governance frameworks components of sms governance        southwest

financial  performance by focusing on our purpose to connect people  to what’s important in their lives through friendly, reliable, and  low-cost air travel. our employees are dedicated to fulfilling  our vision to be the world’s most loved, most efficient,  and most profitable airline. jobs and benefits, returns on  investment, business partnerships, and customer service and  safety are all ways our financial performance matters to our  stakeholder groups—employees, customers, shareholders,  suppliers, and the communities in which we operate.   southwest recognizes the potential positive and negative  impacts that our financial performance may have on  employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers, and the  communities in which we operate. we maintain relationships  with all these stakeholder groups, and we frequently  communicate—sharing southwest’s perspective and listening  to their feedback which can inform our future actions.    southwest employees can share in the company’s success via  the southwest airlines co. profitsharing plan (“profitsharing  plan”), a defined contribution plan and the first-of-its-kind  in the airline industry. subject to the board of directors’  discretion and approval of a profitsharing award, southwest’s  profitsharing plan gives employees the opportunity to share in  the company’s profits. greater profitability allows employees  to potentially receive a larger award under the   profitsharing plan. focus areas annual goals available seat miles (asms ) modest new market growth and leverage robust network to connect dots and

performance can lead to increased returns on   their investment .    additionally, stronger financial performance gives us an  opportunity to increase our procurement in accordance with  our business needs, which can benefit suppliers. southwest’s  financial performance can also impact the communities  we serve, as stronger results can protect jobs and positively  impact economic growth in those areas. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship fleet management   at southwest, we only operate boeing   aircraft, and, with  more than    s, we operate the largest all-boeing    fleet in the world. this single-fleet strategy helps keep costs  low, supports efficient operations, and allows for simplified  scheduling in our point-to-point network. it also helps  streamline our operating procedures and training approach  for our employees and business partners. above all, operating  a single fleet type helps us maintain focus on our number  one priority—safety for our employees and customers. while  our fleet management strategy has many benefits, we do  recognize our reliance on a single manufacturer. we regularly  review our fleet strategy with senior leadership and our board  of directors to validate our operational and fleet philosophy.     part of our approach to fleet management also involves a  focus on fleet modernization as we recognize the importance  of operating aircraft that are more fuel efficient, optimal  for our operation, and which provide our customers a  comfortable experience. to support that goal, as of december   ,  , we have firm orders for more than    new -  and  -  aircraft through   to replace older - s—bringing more  fuel efficiency and lowering operating costs.   as compared with the prior generation of   aircraft, the -   and -  aircraft, with leap- b engines (cfm international),  provide increased fuel efficiency, a quieter engine, and  inherently contributes to an increased range. introducing  updated aircraft also benefits our customers: the cabin of  the -  and -  aircraft features an adjustable headrest; a lower  profile armrest; advanced cushion support; and a raised  information pocket and elevated rear seat beam that together  bring additional space for personal devices. all -  and -   aircraft also enter

furthermore, we actively manage our fleet to meet our plans  for network growth. the -  is expected to be the longest- range aircraft in the southwest fleet, enabling us to enhance  our existing route network.  fleet management has an opportunity to influence both  internal and external impacts. as the fleet is modernized, our  carbon emissions intensity is impacted by better procedures,  efficiency, and a focus on modernization. this topic can also  be impacted by supply chain implications with a desire to  modernize aircraft and retire older aircraft.  under the executive leadership of our cfo, our fleet  management team works with stakeholders across the  organization to manage our aircraft acquisitions and  retirements. the southwest team works toward a strategic  goal of optimizing total cost of ownership and improving  efficiencies across the fleet while meeting our customer,  employee, and operational needs.  governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship network & growth southwest airlines is focused on building flight schedules that  connect customers with the important destinations in their  lives, at the appropriate time, and with the optimal frequency,  while balancing operational efficiency, cost, and long-term  growth strategy.   our network strategy blends nonstop and connecting routes  to the top destinations customers want to fly, designed  around the local demand in the communities we serve.  more than   years of replicating this model has established  southwest as a preferred carrier (no.   in market share) in    of the top   u.s. markets, and we have the no.   or no.    market share in   domestic cities. as of december  ,   , southwest served   nonstop city pairs connecting  more than   airports, resulting in no connections required  for approximately  % of southwest customers. and, for  customers who need to connect, southwest leverages more  than   cities as connect points across our network, an  intentional strategic move to set us apart from the competition  which utilizes only a few hubs for connections.   southwest has boldly taken advantage of network  opportunities since  . during the covid-  pandemic, we  put idle aircraft to work and utilized our people to capitalize on  new network opportunities, supporting southwest’s short- term recovery and long-term growth. as part of our recovery from the impacts of the covid-  pandemic, southwest  remains focused on maturing newer markets and restoring its  network to pre-pandemic levels through adding back breadth  and frequency to southwest’s network while balancing  our network schedule with our crew resources. in    specifically, we prioritized growth in stronghold southwest  markets and short and medium-haul routes, added schedule  depth through additional flight departures to existing nonstop  routes, and supported expansion in key communities like  denver and austin.   southwest deeply values the relationships we have with  our communities and considers these to be long-term  partnerships. dozens of factors are evaluated when  considering a city for potential southwest service, such  as customer demand, existing airline service provided,  proximity to other southwest cities, and infrastructure  capabilities to support southwest’s operating requirements.  we strive to provide a competitive product for our customers  and regularly examine destinations as considerations for future  southwest service. our people work diligently to maintain low  costs, provide low fares, and deliver legendary hospitality, all  of which are important to position southwest well for future  network growth opportunities. governance

well-known  southwest effect of invigorating competition by reducing fares  and stimulating additional passenger traffic in the cities   where we fly.  our presence in communities can encourage economic  activity beyond the direct economic impact on our financial  performance, including creating additional local jobs  and increased access to services. by working with local  communities and regulators, we strive to maximize our  contributions to benefit and enhance local and regional  economies and help communities thrive where our customers  and employees live and work. to utilize our resources responsibly, we regularly review our  annual charitable contributions and continue to evaluate their  effectiveness through impact reports and ongoing touchpoints  with key partners and stakeholders.  we believe that educated communities are empowered  communities. this is shown through our continued investment  in programs that provide educational access for all. from  scholarships to a collegiate travel award program, we work  to remove financial barriers so students can pursue higher  education or other career pathways and, ultimately, have the  ability to give back to their communities in meaningful ways.  operational performance southwest airlines is renowned for our purpose and vision,  firmly rooted in running an operation that connects people  to what’s important in their lives through friendly, reliable,  and low-cost air travel, while simultaneously striving to be  the world’s most loved, most efficient, and most profitable  airline. beginning with the launch of the airline in the early   s, we used the famous “ -minute turn” to maintain  efficiencies while taking on larger competitors, and since  then, committed to a similar philosophy. over the last    years, southwest’s network breadth and fleet size have grown  considerably. teams across the company are dedicated to the  modernization and operational improvements necessary to  achieve our strategic priorities, including managing operations  from an efficiency and reliability perspective, relative to  southwest’s modern size and scale.  the company monitors and analyzes the daily, monthly, and  annual operational performance of our airline. this includes  closely examining data points such as ontime performance for  every flight, the time required to turn aircraft by aircraft type,  along with other metrics such as the amount of time needed  to safely taxi out, takeoff, and fly aircraft to their destinations  in various operating conditions. thousands of additional  data points are used to forecast, trend, monitor, and adjust  elements of our operation to achieve safe, reliable efficiencies  from the time an aircraft arrives at the gate, deplanes, loads  up again, and arrives at its next destination—which occurred  nearly  ,   times per day during some peak season days in   . operationally focused teams at southwest are   dedicated to:   ●identifying problems or opportunities impacting  operations and providing diagnostic analysis to inform  decisions, including crew staffing and productivity.   ● providing timely operational performance reporting,  forecasting operational trends (including on-time  performance trends), and informing our network design  decisions.   ● assessing how we design, build, and operate a schedule  with a focus on proper staffing and capacity planning,  overseeing station readiness and improvements, and  strategically responding to unplanned events (e.g.,  covid-  or weather events).  of course, our focus extends beyond merely monitoring our  current performance. we have a defined governance structure  in place that provides a clear process to efficiently assess,  approve, manage, and deliver outcomes of strategic projects  within our operations portfolio, with the goal of continuously  advancing our operational capabilities. southwest is also  always looking for new innovations and tools to shape the  future of our airline. this includes regularly developing and  testing operational enhancements in simulated and real- world environments to foster a forward-thinking approach  to our operational tools and processes through continuous  improvement, data science and automation, and a focus  on emerging trends. while we will always be proud of our  operational legacy, we have our sights set on planning for the  operation of the future so that we can continue to offer our  employees and customers a reliable, efficient, and modern  airline experience. governance        southwest airlines one

belief that the company prospers when we are safe, low cost,  reliable, and hospitable. delivering hospitality means that  southwest employees and customers feel welcomed, cared  for, and appreciated. we have dedicated teams in place to  provide resources and training opportunities to support our  people in continuing the legacy of legendary hospitality that  southwest is known for. a key component of southwest’s  vision is to be the world’s most loved airline. we work to  achieve this vision by:   ●improving customer satisfaction by enhancing current  offerings and working to remove friction from the  customer journey.   ● bolstering customer loyalty by providing proactive  customer engagement and convenient assistance.  we measure “most loved” through regular reporting on  key metrics like the department of transportation’s (dot)  customer satisfaction results, net promoter score (nps), and  trip net promoter score (tnps). we actively solicit customer  feedback on their southwest travel experience through regular  post-trip surveys. customers share their level of satisfaction  with multiple aspects of their travel experience, including  airport lobby, tsa screening, gate area, boarding process,  inflight experience, connection process, deplaning process,  and baggage claim. we use these insights to understand wins  and pain points for our customers across all aspects of their  travel journey and all southwest stations to inform future  actions. in  , southwest announced major customer  experience enhancements. we are always looking for  additional opportunities to equip our employees to serve our  customers with even more warmth, hospitality, and heart,  giving our customers more reasons than ever to fly southwest.  for more details on our customer experience enhancements,  please see the transforming the customer experience  story  for additional information.  the external impact of legendary customer service is  represented in the thought that treating customers right is  not only good for business, but good for society as well. the  heart in our logo celebrates the dignity and worth of every  human being. southwest seeks to raise the bar for customer  satisfaction throughout the entire aviation industry—but our  desire to provide top service doesn’t stop there. we aspire  to be the gold standard for customer satisfaction for every  company worldwide. internally, southwest relies heavily  on highly engaged employees to produce the culture and  customer experience that has made southwest famous.  the southwest model lends itself

states  ("gaap"). these gaap financial statements may include (i) unrealized noncash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a  result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii)  other charges and benefits the company believes are unusual and/or infrequent in nature and thus may make comparisons to its prior or future  performance difficult.      as a result, the company also provides financial information in this report that was not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be  considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with gaap. the company provides supplemental non-gaap financial  information (also referred to as "excluding special items"), including results that it refers to as "economic," which the company's management  utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental  information to its gaap results. the non-gaap measures provided that relate to the company’s performance on an economic fuel cost basis  include: net income, non-gaap.      the company's economic fuel and oil expense results differ from gaap results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel  hedge contracts—all reflected within fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. thus, fuel and oil expense on an economic basis has  historically been utilized by the company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the company’s actual net cash  outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. any net premium costs paid related to option contracts  that are designated as hedges are reflected as a component of fuel and oil expense, for both gaap and non-gaap (including economic) purposes  in the period of contract settlement. the company believes these economic results provide further insight into the impact of the company's fuel  hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, noncash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded  in gaap results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel  derivative contracts within fuel and oil expense. this enables the company's management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess  the company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel  expense. however, because these measures are not determined in accordance with gaap, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations,  and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. as a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly  comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.      further information on (i) the company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes  of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in note   to the consolidated financial  statements on form  -k for the fiscal year ended december  ,  .      the company’s gaap results in the applicable periods may include other charges or benefits that are also deemed "special items," that the  company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends. financial measures  identified as non-gaap (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. for the periods presented, in addition to the  items discussed above, special items include:      • proceeds related to the payroll support programs, which were used to pay a portion of employee salaries, wages, and benefits;   • changes and adjustments to previously accrued amounts related to the company's extended leave programs;   •  adjustments for prior period losses reclassified from aoci associated with forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that were terminated  in prior periods related to   -  aircraft leases; • noncash impairment charges, primarily associated with adjustments to salvage values for previously retired airframes;   • unrealized mark-to-market adjustment associated with certain available for sale securities; and   • losses associated with the partial extinguishment of the company’s convertible notes and early prepayment of debt.number endnote description pb      southwest airlines one report frameworks frameworks        southwest airlines

management determined that presentation within its income statement would be enhanced by classification of loss on  extinguishment of debt as a separate line item, rather than its prior presentation where it was included as a component of other (gains) losses,  net. such losses are incurred as a result of opportunistic decisions made by the company to prepay portions of its debt, most of which was taken  on during the pandemic in order to provide liquidity during the prolonged downturn in air travel. due to the nature of these losses, which are  difficult to accurately predict, and due to the fact that they are not representative of the company’s day-to-day airline operating performance,  the company has included such amounts as special items and thus excluded them from certain of its non-gaap measures in the accompanying  reconciliation.      because management believes special items can distort the trends associated with the company’s ongoing performance as an airline, the  company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact  of special items, in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis  for evaluating operating results in future periods. the following measure is often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the company’s  management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to industry trends: net income, non-gaap.
