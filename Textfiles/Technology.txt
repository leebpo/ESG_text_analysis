progress around esg efforts.    today, this report aligns with our company purpose—to power  an inclusive future for all—and it illustrates the many ways  cisco brings this to life. we remain committed to annually  sharing the impact we are making in critical areas such as  sustainability, inclusion and diversity, human rights, education,  economic development, and crisis response. the ways in  which we support our customers, care for our employees,   and serve our communities define our company today, just   as they did nearly two decades ago.  while no one could have predicted the challenges we’ve  faced over the last few years, one thing remains clear—cisco  plays an important role in not only helping our customers solve  their biggest business issues, but also making this world a  better place for all of us. setting clear goals and measuring  our progress keeps us accountable and allows us to share  what we are learning from our experience and work.  each day, we use our technology, expertise, and scale to drive  progress, whether that’s supporting our ukraine employees,  customers, and their communities affected by the war; delivering  on our social justice

reporting hub at cisco, pursuing our purpose—to power   an inclusive future for all—is a journey. what set us on this journey was our deep commitment,   and a deeply held responsibility, to leverage our unique  strengths and success as a company to improve people’s  lives, everywhere. we know we can harness the power of  connectivity, which is the foundation of everything we do,   to help address the challenges our society faces. we’ve been on this journey for many years, and we don’t  know the turns we’ll make, or the obstacles we’ll face along  the way. but our commitment to our purpose continues to  drive us forward, to respond in times of crisis, and to use   our technology, our people, and our networks to bridge the  digital divide, help address climate change, and open more  opportunities for more people.  following this journey means that we must question ourselves  and adjust along the way. how do we know we’re on the right  path? how do we know we’re making progress? what are we  measuring, and are those the right metrics?  as our work progresses, so too does our understanding of  what drives impact. we don’t always have the answers—in  fact, we know we’ll make mistakes. but we also know that  mistakes are part of improving and getting us closer to the  metrics that truly matter: the impact we’re making and the  lives we touch. while this report highlights impressive numbers, the human  stories behind them are the real victories. educating  .  million  students through cisco networking academy is a striking  statistic, but for the person who goes back to school because  of a course they took or the person who gets their first job  because of a certification it is not a statistic—it is life changing.  and with every person we impact, every school we connect,  every community we empower, we personify our purpose.  beyond the numbers and the statistics, that is our north star,  and it will continue to guide us. a message from  francine katsoudas as we move forward on our journey, we will continue to  challenge ourselves to drive greater impact. we will show up  to every challenge—business, social, and environmental—with  intention. we will consider the people we can lift up, and we  will take action for what we believe is right and just. we may  not always succeed, but we’re not wavering from our path or  our commitment. our customers,

using  our previous methodology, visit the historic ghg methodology  discussion in the strategy, goals and emissions data section  on our esg hub .     packaging efficiency is measured by comparing the size of the product relative to the packaging using dimensional weight.  dimensional weight uses volume and a standard dimensional factor to calculate the weight of a package. in this methodology,  the packaging efficiency metric is based on the difference of the normalized dimensional weight (by volume) between the  baseline and current year.    in fiscal  , we had a soft launch of the scoring tool to evaluate   percent of new products and packaging, and   percent  of them successfully met our circular design criteria. this is equivalent to   percent of total new products and packaging

net-zero goal align with  cisco’s purpose to power an inclusive  future for all? we can’t have any kind of future if we  don’t have a healthy planet. beyond that,  the promise of technology is that it enables  us to rethink business models in ways that  are digital and low-carbon, but also improve  individual wellbeing and create opportunities  for communities. one example is hybrid work,  which helps enable inclusion because it allows  us to include more people, and more work  styles, in more places. hybrid work can also  have environmental benefits, particularly when  combined with smart building technology that  uses sensors and low-voltage power over  ethernet. these innovations allow us to monitor  and control temperature, lighting, and air quality,  as well as reduce embodied carbon from steel  conduits and copper wiring. this is the kind of  digital, low-carbon, inclusive thinking we want  to accelerate—holistic solutions that benefit  business, people, communities, and the planet.why was now the right time for cisco   to set a net-zero goal? our world is at a tipping point. i think we’re  all seeing the impact of climate change,  whether in the form of hurricanes, flooding,  droughts, or fires. given the climate reality, it’s  time for societies to think beyond mitigation  and consider adaptation and regeneration as  well. this moment also presents an inflection  point for businesses. to survive in this new  reality, businesses must become not only  digital, but also low-carbon. cisco has   helped our customers accelerate their digital  transformations since our founding, and today  we have an opportunity to bring about a  low-carbon transformation through our global  reach as well.q aq aa net-zero  business is just  the beginning  mary de wysocki, cisco’s first chief  sustainability officer, shares the strides  the company has made not just toward  decarbonizing our own business—but bringing  customers, suppliers, and community partners  along for the journey.  future intro power inclusive     cisco purpose report  |  csr.cisco.com   |  esg reporting hub cisco has a long history of goal-setting— including more than a decade’s worth of  emissions goals—and rigorously reporting  on and validating those goals. why is  validation so important? it’s important to help validate our impact  through external verification because it  ensures that our actions are having the outcomes  we intend. cisco’s net zero by   goal achieved  validation from the sbti under its new net-zero  standard, which requires us to reduce our absolute  scope  ,  , and   emissions   percent by  .  the sbti also requires interim goals and annual  updates on progress that will keep us accountable. having an sbti-validated goal means that  you must address emissions across your  value chain, not just your own operations.  how do you approach reducing emissions  and driving transformation more broadly? helping our customers and suppliers meet  their own decarbonization goals is a critical  way that cisco will help bring about a digital and  low-carbon future. the use of cisco’s products  makes up the majority of our emissions footprint.  our engineers have made great progress in power  efficiency and circular design, and we’re also  seeing customers ask for more capabilities and  greater bandwidth that increase power demands.  that means we must think even bigger, exploring  ways to accelerate renewable energy adoption  and the greening of the grid. our second-largest  source of emissions is our supply chain. cisco has  set a goal that   percent of our top component,  manufacturing and logistics suppliers will set  public ghg emissions reductions targets by   , and we regularly share our learnings   with them.q a q acisco has practiced a social investment  strategy focused on early-stage solutions  for more than   years through the cisco  foundation. how will your experience in  this space support emissions reduction  beyond your value chain?  the cisco foundation—along with innovation  competitions we organize like the cisco  global problem solver challenge—helps  stimulate cutting-edge innovation in areas where  it’s most needed. today, the foundation focuses  on early-stage decarbonization technology and  nature-based solutions to climate change. these  investments send a signal to other investors  about what we value and where we believe the  future is headed. a recent cisco foundation grantee i’m particularly  excited about is seacology and its dominican  republic mangrove initiative , which supports  businesses that protect the country’s critical  mangrove forests. mangroves are known for  helping sequester carbon as well as protecting  coastlines from storm surges and sea level rise—   a great example of tackling both climate change  mitigation and adaptation at the same time. the  initiative also provides jobs for residents in  vulnerable coastal areas, building powerful  connections with members of these  communities and demonstrating the   importance of inclusion in the   low-carbon transition.q a photo credit: seacologyfuture intro power inclusive

esg reporting hub security, privacy  and trust data underlies nearly every aspect of how we  work, play, learn, and connect. the security  and privacy of data, therefore, is closely tied   to many of the world’s challenges. today, as teams increasingly work in a distributed fashion,  organizations need new ways to securely connect users,  applications, and things. threats such as ransomware and  exploitation of software vulnerabilities are increasingly  commonplace. cyberspace has become a new frontier in  global warfare. for example, since the russian invasion of  ukraine , cyber attacks against ukrainian users have surged.   in this environment, regulatory and consumer expectations    of companies regarding security, privacy, and trust are higher  than ever—and cisco is proud to be a leader in this space. as  a large, global enterprise, we must safeguard our business  and help customers do the same. our security products and  solutions provide the protection that businesses need. we   are also committed to sharing our perspective on matters of  security, privacy, and trust so that all organizations can operate  more safely. to this end, in fiscal  , cisco published the  new trust standard —a compilation of what we’ve learned from  our experiences securing and digitally enabling thousands of  customers around the world. while the building blocks of trust  will surely evolve further in response to changing customer  expectations, technology, cyber threats, and international data  governance, the new trust standard provides a framework  for trusted digital relationships today. our impact our commitment to transparency  governmental organizations at all levels around the world use  cisco technology. they also set policies and regulations that  determine how technology should operate. engaging with  policymakers, regulators, and government agencies on matters  related to security, privacy, and trust is an essential part of   our work. for example, we occasionally receive requests  for  data related to ongoing investigations from law enforcement,  intelligence agencies, or governments. when this happens, cisco  follows a strict set of policies and procedures  to help ensure  that data disclosures are minimized and controlled, and that  access to our solutions and services remains free from unlawful  intrusion. we publish data related to these requests, including  the number of requests by country and how many requests we  fulfill or reject, every six months in our transparency reports . on may  ,  , u.s. president joe biden signed an executive  order mandating more transparency in the software supply chain.  cisco stood ready to respond  to this order and supports the tech  industry’s adoption of software bills of materials (sboms). later  in the year, after a vulnerability was discovered in the apache  log j   open-source software, cisco senior vice president  and chief security and trust officer brad arkin spoke  to a

product lifecycle.valuing  privacy and  inclusion in  software  designwhen it comes to powering an inclusive future for all, respect   for human rights is a fundamental innovation principle. privacy,  security, and inclusion must be central in the design methodology,  especially when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine  learning. training data sets often determine how product design  and user experience take shape—the adage “goodness in, goodness  out” certainly applies. developers must take steps to ensure these  data sets are robust, diverse, and representative of all users.  failing to do so can result in inaccuracies, disappointing user  experiences, and unintended bias.   take, for example, webex virtual backgrounds, which are designed  to hide users’ surroundings to enhance privacy, security,  professionalism, and fun. early research versions of this feature,  which reflected the state of the art at the time, did not perform well  for certain hair textures and styles, or lighting conditions. in some  cases, they inadvertently filtered out portions of a user’s  appearance. our engineers recognized that broader, more diverse  training data sets that were representative of the webex user base  were required, and addressed this during the design phase before  releasing the feature. by applying data that was anonymized,  ethically sourced, user-contributed, open-source, provided with  explicit consent, and respectful of individual privacy in other ways,  we made the training data more robust. this resulted in more  representative images and algorithms, and a much better and more  inclusive user experience for all.   in  , we built on the learnings from the webex team and  launched our responsible ai framework based on six principles:  transparency, fairness, accountability, privacy, security, and  reliability. our responsible ai working group continuously drives  adherence to these principles by putting new technologies through  responsible ai impact assessments, offering guidance on how to  manage risk to human rights, and providing accountability via  incident reporting of human rights, privacy, and security concerns.

joint cyber defense collaborative. we   are steadfast in upholding our commitments to security and  privacy by design, anchored on the principles of transparency,  fairness, and accountability. at the same time, we are raising the  bar to meet new threats and current realities. for example, we  are taking steps to secure open-source software, responsibly  disclose vulnerabilities in our products and services, support  government and third-party initiatives to deliver more  trustworthy software, and enable data free flows with trust  (dfft) . we are also strengthening our capabilities to help  customers defend their critical infrastructure—like hospitals,  utilities, transportation, and government services—against  threats. protecting these essential functions amounts to  keeping as many organizations as possible above the   “cyber security poverty line .” sharing our expertise with all  we view security and privacy as an imperative for all  organizations. that’s why we work to share our knowledge  and solutions widely with our customers, industry associations,  and private- and public-sector organizations around the  world. for our employee base, cisco offers both required  security and privacy training to all employees and specialized  training and certifications for security and privacy professionals.  we share tips for users to keep themselves and their families  safe

the rapid pace of innovation.  we focus on striving to protect all groups, and particularly vulnerable ones,  from harm. these measures include auditing for proper treatment of people  working for our

looking across the value chain to help address human  rights impacts that we may be linked to through our business relationships.  we integrate human rights into our product design methodologies. for  example, ai/ml technologies have the potential to make sense of large  amounts of data more quickly and efficiently than humans can. but they can  also make mistakes that could harm human rights or erode customer trust.  in addition to cisco’s responsible ai framework, the responsible ai/ml  committee, also established in fiscal  , defines and directs governance  of the implementation and use of ai across our operations and solutions.  with this structure in place, we are now conducting assessments to help us  identify risks and consult with product teams as they work to address them.one of cisco’s   social justice  actions  is to embed a human  rights perspective into the daily  aspects of how we operate.   this includes incorporating  human rights into our corporate  governance,

the design of our products. when designing  new products, power and performance mean a constant  tradeoff. to reduce the emissions associated with the use  of our products, we are making improvements in four key  areas: power; thermal; high-speed interconnects and asics;  and integration into our customer facilities (read more in  the esg reporting hub ). in fiscal  , we completed our  energy efficiency goal, achieving   percent system  power efficiency in our large rack-mounted equipment,  as measured from the input power from the facility to the  board-mounted asics, memory, and other chip devices.  we reached this goal by focusing on three of our four  areas for improvement, including using high-efficiency  power supplies, optimizing asic power distribution, and  optimizing system power distribution. to accelerate the decarbonization of our value chain and  help our customers achieve their own sustainability goals,  we created a new engineering sustainability office in  fiscal  . this group works across cisco’s engineering  teams and in partnership with other functions to design  sustainable products, offers, and solutions, guided by one  roadmap with measurable results.  sustainable data centers data centers require ongoing energy  management to handle vast amounts  of data. in cisco lab tests, the new  nexus   series switches, built  using modular design and both   plus  titanium-rated and platinum-rated  power supplies, were shown to be    .  times more efficient than the    g gx-based nexus   series.hybrid work webex is our integrated solution that  creates

vehicles (evs) trying to charge at the same time.  vehicle-to-grid (v g) technologies could help reduce pressure  on electricity grids, especially during peak charging times. these  technologies would treat every ev like a battery that can supply  power back to a network or building. for now, v g is just a  concept—but a recent cisco partnership is helping bring it   closer to commercial reality.  the e-flex  project—a joint initiative between cisco’s country  digital acceleration  (cda) program, imperial college london,  and other partners—is proving the potential of v g with fleets of  vehicles owned by public and private-sector organizations. twenty  locations around the united kingdom were outfitted with two-way  charging stations from which data was collected. as a lead partner  on the project, cisco provided secure connectivity at the charging  stations through its umbrella cloud security solution, and cisco  meraki cameras added to physical security.  if it proves successful at scale, v g could become a critical part of  a lower-carbon future, as well as helping energy managers reduce  operational costs. this project provided a glimpse of what that future  could look like. “vehicles can act as local energy storage alongside  renewables,” says peter shearman, cisco head of innovation, united  kingdom and ireland. v g technology could be deployed at smart

packaging efficiency is measured by comparing the size of the product relative to the packaging using  dimensional weight. dimensional weight uses volume and a standard dimensional factor to calculate the  weight of a package. in this methodology, the packaging efficiency metric is based on the difference of  the normalized dimensional weight (by volume) between the baseline and current year.    in fiscal  , we had a soft launch of the scoring tool to evaluate   percent of new products and  packaging, and   percent of them successfully met our circular design criteria. this is equivalent to     percent of total new products and packaging released in fiscal   meeting circular design criteria.  in early fiscal  , the scoring tool was formally launched across all business units, so we expect the  universe of new products and packaging evaluated to increase in fiscal  .    the plastics included in this goal exclude those contained in commodity components sourced from  suppliers (e.g., plastic screws, fans, and cables).    according to current standard definitions used in certification protocols, “zero waste” diversion is defined  as a   percent or greater overall diversion of solid, nonhazardous wastes from landfill, incineration  (waste-to-energy), and the environment. diversion methods can include reduction,   reuse, recycling, and/or compost.visit cisco’s esg reporting

corporate operations, including direct  emissions as well as business travel and  employee commute. our  -year climate roadmap is addressing  apple’s carbon footprint through five pillars: low-carbon design:  we will design products  and manufacturing processes to be less  carbon-intensive through thoughtful material  selection, increased material efficiency, and  greater product energy efficiency. energy efficiency:  we will increase energy  efficiency at our facilities and in our supply  chain by finding opportunities, such as  retrofitting, to reduce energy use. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     renewable electricity:  we will continue to  source   percent renewable electricity for  our facilities, and transition our entire supply  chain to   percent clean, renewable sources  of electricity. direct emissions abatement:  we will   reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions in   our facilities and our supply chain through  process innovation, emissions abatement, and  the use of non- fossil -based low -carbon fuels. carbon removal:  working in parallel with  our emissions reduction efforts, we will scale  up investments in carbon removal projects,  including nature -based solutions that protect  and restore ecosystems around the world. low-carbon design to reduce the carbon footprint of our products,  we’re increasing efficiency and transitioning  to materials from recycled sources and those  made using low-carbon energy. in  , we  continued to improve the carbon efficiency of  the integrated circuits we use in our products  — components we’ve prioritized because they  are carbon-intensive. for example, switching  to the apple m  chip for the  -inch macbook  pro reduced the energy needed to manufacture  and use the device, driving down the product’s  carbon footprint by over   percent. we’ve continued to expand our use of    percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures  of a number of products. all ipad models in our  lineup now use   percent recycled aluminum  in their enclosures — joining apple watch  series  , apple watch se, macbook air, mac  mini, and the  -inch and  -inch macbook pro  devices. for products released in   that had  enclosures made with primary aluminum, we energy efficiency we’re focused on using less energy across  our operations, beginning with how we design,  operate, and maintain our facilities. and we  continue these same efforts into our supply  chain, which benefits the communities where  our suppliers operate. drawing less energy from  electrical grids — many of which still rely heavily  on fossil fuels — helps reduce local air pollution  and improve air quality for nearby communities. the emissions from manufacturing our products  account for about   percent of apple’s gross  carbon footprint. we launched our supplier energy  efficiency program in   with the goal of helping  suppliers optimize their facilities and operations  to use as little energy as possible. we provide  guidance designed to help suppliers uncover  opportunities for energy efficiency. suppliers in  our supplier

have decreased the carbon  emissions associated with our use of aluminum  by   percent since  . product energy use accounts for   percent   of our gross carbon footprint — and has an  impact on the individual energy use of each   of our customers. by addressing this in the  earliest phases of design, we’ve cut the product  energy use across all major product lines by  more than   percent since   through  energy efficiency improvements.  in fiscal  year  , over   percent of apple’s eligible  products, by revenue, received an energy  star rating for superior energy efficiency.    and over   percent of apple’s eligible  products, by revenue, met the requirements   for epeat registration.  appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg

of transitioning our  manufacturing supply chain to   percent  renewable electricity by  . as of march   ,   manufacturing partners in    countries have committed to   percent  renewable energy for apple production. over   percent of companies on apple’s  supplier list — those suppliers that make  up   percent of apple’s direct spend for  materials, manufacturing, and assembly of  our products worldwide — have committed to    percent renewable electricity. in addition,  many other smaller suppliers have also made  these commitments.direct emissions abatement to address the non-electricity emissions  associated with our materials and  manufacturing processes, we seek  technological solutions through emissions  abatement or switching to low-carbon fuel  options. for example, we partnered with  aluminum companies and the governments  of canada and quebec to help fund research  and development for elysis, a technology that  eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions  from aluminum smelting. many components essential to products like  ours, including integrated circuit chips and  display panels, currently rely on manufacturing  processes that use fluorinated gases, which  have high global warming potential. we’re  partnering closely with key manufacturers  to prevent these gases from being  released into the atmosphere by optimizing  manufacturing processes and deploying  abatement technologies. to address emissions from shipping products  to our customers, we’re shifting whenever  possible toward less carbon-intensive shipping  modes, such as rail and ocean. and we’re  seeking out technical innovations, including  alternative fuels and electric vehicles. in fiscal  year  , apple avoided  ,  metric tons  of co  e by shifting the mode of transport and  reducing product weight through the removal   of the power adapter from the box of  iphone devices. providing access to clean energy in south africa  even a few years ago, not everyone in one community in south africa had electricity   at home. many people had been using battery-powered lanterns because upfront costs  and other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach. as we worked with our  partners to identify new renewable energy projects for our power for impact program,   we saw exciting potential in this community.  our partner on the ground, dc go, a solar energy provider based in johannesburg,   got to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs.  ultimately, dc go developed a pay-as-you-go model that brought solar energy to    homes that previously lacked access. this was possible only because of the way they   built relationships with community members and worked with apple to price the solution   in line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns. in addition, dc go hired and trained local people for jobs in sales, maintenance,   and other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project   — and the community’s access to electricity — would be sustainable over time.   this is just one example of how the power for impact program is working to benefit  communities, our company, and the environment at the same time. learn more   on pages   and   of our environmental progress report . with access to electricity in their homes, kids can now do homework

we can’t yet avoid,  we’re are investing in carbon removal projects.  in addition to removing carbon, nature-based  carbon removal projects also offer important  ecological and social benefits, such as preserving  biodiversity and enhancing the resilience of  ecosystems, while often providing economic  development opportunities for local communities. we partnered with conservation international  and goldman sachs to launch the innovative  restore fund, which seeks to blend responsible  forestry practices with carbon removal: we’re  working with forestry managers to create  sustainably managed forests that optimize for  both carbon and wood production, creating  revenue from timber, and generating high- quality carbon credits. apple will invest up to  $  million in projects that aim to remove  carbon from the atmosphere and store it, all  while meeting clear social and environmental  impact criteria and offering a financial return.   in its pilot phase, the restore fund has a goal   of removing at least   million metric tons of  carbon dioxide per year.for more information on our efforts to combat  climate change and reach our   carbon  neutral goal, read our   environmental  progress report .climate scenario analysis  in  , we conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical and  transition effects of climate change. to align with the task force on climate-related financial disclosures  (tcfd) recommendations, we considered a range of future scenarios, including a scenario below  °c.  and we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities. the  analysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our  corporate resiliency. it also provided environmental data that we considered in developing business strategies,  including considerations around supply chain diversification, as well as safeguarding our global assets. we’re committed to managing regulatory, reputational, and market risks related to climate change.   for more information on these climate-related risks and apple’s governance of these risks, read our     cdp submission (pdf) . as the restore fund projects come online, we’ve partnered with conservation international to  develop and invest in nature-based carbon removal projects. this includes a project to protect   and restore  ,  acres of mangrove forests in colombia.as the projects in the restore fund come  online, we’re also working to address difficult- to-avoid emissions in the short term. in fiscal  year  ,  ,  metric tons of carbon  credits were retired from the chyulu hills   project in kenya to maintain carbon neutrality  for our corporate emissions in fiscal year   . and we purchased carbon credits from  two additional projects to offset a total of   ,  metric tons of direct emissions across  our value chain: a redd+ coastal conservation  project in guatemala  and a reforestation project  in guizhou province of china . these projects  are all certified to the vcs and ccb standards. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     resources  natural resources make our work possible —  and we take responsibility for how we source,  use, and recycle the materials we rely on to  create our products. as a starting point, this  means sourcing responsibly, minimizing our  freshwater use, and eliminating waste across  our operations and those of our suppliers.  and we’re also seeking to redefine the overall  resource footprint of our products. our goal is   to one day make products using only responsibly  sourced recycled and renewable materials. within resources, we focus on three main   areas of impact: • materials:  transitioning to only recycled  or renewable materials in our products  and packaging, and maximizing material  efficiency, product longevity, and recovery. • water:  reducing water impacts in the  manufacturing of our products, use of our  services, and operation of our facilities.   at the same time, transitioning to alternative  sources, improving the quality of water  we discharge, and protecting shared  water resources. • zero waste: minimizing overall waste  generated and eliminating waste sent to  landfill from our manufacturing supply chain  as well as corporate offices, data centers,   and retail stores.materials we aim to make the best use of the materials we  rely on to make our products. that’s why we’re  focusing on three different levers to reduce  our footprint and achieve circularity: sourcing  and efficiency; product longevity; and product  end-of-life. sourcing and efficiency last year, we made progress across materials —  from expanding our use of recycled rare earth  elements to designing cameras with recycled  gold. in september, we introduced iphone  ,  with more certified recycled materials than any  previous version of iphone. we also introduced    percent recycled aluminum enclosures on  every single model in the ipad lineup.welcoming the first class of the impact accelerator  last year, we welcomed the first class to our impact accelerator, a program for black- ,hispanic/latinx-, and indigenous-owned businesses headquartered in the united states  that share our focus on innovation and our commitment to the environment. part of apple’s  racial equity and justice initiative (see page   ), the accelerator aims to help combat  systemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for communities  most impacted by climate change.  we selected our first class of   businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and  clean energy to begin the program in august  . the three-month program included live  virtual sessions, online courses on supply chain management, supplier diversity, financial  and legal subjects, as well as one-on-one mentorship with an apple expert on topics from  renewable energy to responsible sourcing. the goal of the impact accelerator is to better position the participating companies for  growth, to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts, and to expand their customer  base — all while fostering their environmental commitment. for example, last october we  announced that we will be working with the oceti sakowin power authority, formed by six  sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources, on a project to create   a wind power development in the midwest. and following the success of this year’s class,  our efforts continue. this spring, applications opened for the next class to join our   impact accelerator. for apple’s inaugural impact accelerator, leaders from   companies participated   in a three-month virtual program with customized training and access to apple   expert mentors.  % in fiscal year  , nearly   percent of  the material we shipped in products came   from recycled and renewable sources  x in fiscal year  , we more than doubled  our use of recycled tungsten, rare earth  elements, and cobalt — and introduced  certified recycled gold for the first time   in an apple product  % we’ve reduced the plastic in our packaging  by   percent compared with  ,  progressing toward our goal to eliminate   all plastic from our packaging by   appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people

— made with    percent recycled content device-wide,  including   percent recycled aluminum in the  enclosure. these and other innovations helped  us increase our use of recycled or renewable  content to   percent of all the material shipped  in products in fiscal year  . product longevity we want to make the most of the materials we  use through designing long-lasting products.  we are designing durable hardware, leveraging  software updates to extend functionality,  expanding access to repair services,  refurbishing devices for their next user, and  reusing parts that still have more to give. read  more on caring for customers on page   . product end-of-life  by effectively recovering the materials in our  products, we enable the circular supply chains  that make the best use of finite resources.  through our work in this area, we’re reducing  the need to mine new materials and the  amount of energy needed to manufacture new  products, ultimately driving down emissions  and conserving resources. in   percent of the countries where we  sell products, we continue to provide and  participate in product take-back and recycling  collection programs. with the help of  customer and employee participation across  recycling programs, we directed more than   ,  metric tons of e-waste to recycling  globally in fiscal year  . we’ve also continued to innovate on  disassembly technologies. daisy, the robot we  designed to disassemble iphone devices, has  now been joined by dave, which dismantles  taptic engines from iphone to enable the  recovery of materials like rare earth elements,  tungsten, and steel, and taz, designed to  recycle modules containing rare earth magnets.  at our material recovery lab we’re working  on developing better, more efficient means of  disassembling products that maximize material  recovery, while minimizing waste.water stewardship we’re committed to managing the resources   we share with the communities where we and  our suppliers operate. our efforts to address  the water footprint of our corporate sites and   of our suppliers’ sites focus on: • using water efficiently • expanding the use of alternative water  sources, including onsite reuse • discharging water responsibly • enhancing our water stewardship to keep  watersheds healthy for all who rely on them in fiscal year  , our facilities used about   .  billion gallons of water. we saved   million  gallons of freshwater this fiscal year due to  efficiency projects implemented since   .   last year, alternative water sources accounted  for   percent of our total corporate water usage  — primarily from recycled water sources.  our supply chain accounts for   percent of  our total water footprint, based on our detailed  water inventory. that’s why we partner closely  with our suppliers through our clean water  program. the more than   participating  supplier sites increased their average reuse  rate to   percent and saved our suppliers   .  billion gallons of freshwater in fiscal year    — for a total of  .  billion gallons of  water savings since the program’s launch  in  . innovating packaging to reduce our footprint we’ve made significant progress toward eliminating all plastics from our packaging by  .  this past year, plastics accounted for only   percent of our packaging. since  , we’ve  dedicated our efforts to replacing large plastic trays, wraps, and foam cushioning with fiber  alternatives that have higher recovery rates and reduced environmental footprints.  this year, the iphone   and iphone   pro were the first iphone models to be shipped  without any plastic packaging components.  and we replaced plastic foam with a fiber  alternative to protect the  -inch imac during shipping. for the  -inch imac, using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorption   allowed us to reduce plastic by   percent. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     smarter chemistry the well-being of our employees, customers,  people in our supply chain, and the planet  is a priority for apple, which is why we’re  committed to using safer materials to create  safer products. this commitment requires  diligent work — to build a comprehensive  picture of chemicals across our supply chain,  to insist on rigorous chemical management  processes, to promote adoption of safer  chemical alternatives, and to innovate through  design smarter approaches to making our  products. using safer chemistry in our  products also enables recycling and material  recovery, so that our products can be the raw  materials for the next generation.the pillars of our smarter chemistry  strategy are: mapping and engagement:  engage our  supply chain partners to comprehensively  identify the chemicals in the materials used   to make our products, allowing us to drive  change that goes beyond what is required   for regulatory compliance. assessment and management:  assess the  potential human health and environmental risks  of chemicals to evaluate compliance with our  requirements and inform product design. innovation:  drive the development and use   of innovative materials that enable the creation  of groundbreaking products and also support  industrywide change. mapping and engagement our full material disclosure (fmd) program  maps the chemicals used in our products —  an effort that includes tens of thousands of  parts and assemblies. then we look at how  our products are manufactured. our chemical  safety disclosure (csd) program engages with  supply chain partners to get the most recent  information on which materials are in use.   this information includes the volume of  materials being consumed and how they’re  being applied, stored, and handled — as well   as the steps being taken to protect employees. more than   supplier facilities have shared  their chemical inventories as well as storage and  safety protocols as part of our csd program.  through this process, we’ve identified more  than   ,  chemicals and applications. these  efforts contribute to a safer work environment  for people across our supply chain.zero waste across our corporate operations, we’re reducing  the amount of waste we generate and directing  more toward recycling programs. in fiscal  year  , recycling and composting efforts  allowed us to achieve a waste diversion rate of    percent, limiting landfill waste from our global  operations to about  ,  metric tons.  our  overall waste generated also remained low, in  part due to covid-related temporary closure  of facilities. last year, our mesa, arizona, data  center became the second apple facility to  receive true certification for zero waste,  following the prineville data center in  .  apple works with the alliance for water stewardship and others to promote water stewardship that protects  the health of water basins, including the

participating facilities  across   countries can access resources  including guidance on how to reduce waste and  then reuse, recycle, or compost the waste they  do create. and we’re seeing results: in fiscal  year  , suppliers redirected  ,  metric  tons of waste from landfills, bringing the total to  over   million metric tons since the program’s  inception — the equivalent of eliminating more  than  .  million square meters of landfill space. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     assessment and management the data we collect on chemicals and materials  forms the foundation for key decisions that  have an impact on our product designs,  manufacturing processes, and approach to  recycling and reuse. this data

fundamental knowledge and skills that  will support their success at apple. ongoing  training opportunities cover apple culture  and values, products and services, systems,  processes, and customer engagement skills. across apple, our managers and leaders help our team members to learn, improve,   and do the best work of their lives.  career experience:  career experiences  enable temporary, hands-on development  opportunities for apple store, service, and  support team members by creating short- term rotations in technical, operations, and  corporate functions across apple. participants  build new skills, explore an aspirational role  up close, and gain in-role experience, while  host teams benefit from the unique customer- facing perspectives, talents, and passions of  participants. the program is currently available  in   locations in every geographic region, with  more countries being added each year, and   % of apple’s lines of business participate. ,   training hours in apple

graduates to learn through  a combination of training and on-the-job  work experience. over a two-year period,  participants rotate through multiple teams to  gain a breadth of experience and exposure to  various projects to help discover their strengths  and passion. upon successful completion of  the program, participants will often transition  into a non-rotating role within apple. our  services, finance, operations, and ai/ml  functions all offer these types of programs. performance reviews  our annual performance review process  offers team members the opportunity to  have meaningful conversations with their  managers about their performance, growth, and  development. across apple, employees receive  an annual performance review, and retail team  members are supported by monthly performance  conversations to align on their progress. performance reviews focus on three categories:  teamwork, innovation, and results, and they  include a self-assessment and feedback from  peers and the team member’s manager. the  performance review is also a chance to reflect  on the contribution each person makes to  apple’s long-standing commitment to inclusion  and diversity. benefits we recognize that our people thrive when  they have the resources to meet their needs  and the time and support to succeed in their  professional and personal lives. we provide  a host of benefits for corporate and retail  employees to help our teams live healthier, more  fulfilled, and happier lives at work and beyond.   we regularly review and update the benefits that  we offer in order to respond to our employees’  changing needs. for example, we recently  expanded family care services and mental health  benefits, including   free counseling sessions  through our employee assistance program, to  help employees care for themselves and their  loved ones through the pandemic. and in the  u.s., we now offer part-time team members  new vacation and sick leave days, new parent  leave, gradual return to work, paid family  care, and emergency backup care, and in  ,  we enhanced sick leave benefits and a new  accelerated vacation accrual schedule for full-time  employees in our u.s. apple store locations. physical and mental well-being apple provides employees with a wide variety   of health-related benefits, including: • physical and mental health coverage that also  extends to spouses and domestic partners • virtual and onsite wellness visits for employees  and eligible dependents • free, confidential counseling for employees  and their dependents   • comprehensive reproductive health services   • expert second opinion resources to help  employees and their family members make  informed healthcare decisions  every year, our performance review process helps team members have meaningful   conversations with their managers. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     • a comprehensive mental health and   well-being hub where employees can find  events, apps, and other resources  • month-long wellness events for team  members across apple to support one  another and build healthier habits  our health plans are designed to support  the various life stages of our employees and  their families. they are transgender inclusive,  where legally and plan allowed, and support  routine care, therapies, and other medically  necessary surgeries.  life and family  apple also provides a number of benefits to  support our employees in their personal and  family life, including:  • retirement programs to help employees with  their future financial needs, such as  (k)  matching contributions in the u.s. and local  retirement plans for employees outside of   the u.s.  • referrals and resources for childcare, which  includes backup care in the u.s., as well  as before- and after-school programs,  programs for children with special needs,  and more  • consultations and referrals to support  employees caring for an elderly  family member  • adoption, surrogacy, and fertility services  • financial coaching services  • tuition reimbursement  • legal services for adoption, child support,  housing, wills, identity theft, and more  coming back to work after the arrival of a child  can be a big adjustment for employees, so to smooth the transition period following the arrival  of a new family member, our gradual return- to-work program allows employees to choose  to return half-time at full pay for four weeks —  whether they’re welcoming a child through birth,  adoption, or other covered means. time away  taking the time to recharge is an important part  of employee health and well-being. we provide  a wide variety of time-away options for our  employees, including:  • vacation •  paid sick time and medical leave for serious  health conditions   • pregnancy leave and new parent leave   • leave for bereavement or to care for a sick  family member  • time off for voting, jury duty, and other  civil obligations  • company holidays throughout the year  product discounts  apple’s employee purchase plan offers special  pricing on most apple products. we offer  substantial discounts on hardware, software,  and accessories for employees, families, and  friends — as well as an additional credit that can  be used to purchase a mac, ipad, or unlocked  iphone once every two years.  compensation  we believe that our compensation should not  only be highly competitive across all types of  roles, levels, and talent markets; it should be equitable and enable all team members to share  in the company’s success as shareholders  of apple. we’re committed to being a leader in pay  equity, providing all employees with annual  opportunities for stock ownership in the  company, and offering highly competitive  pay that’s in the top tier of each local market.  and we hold our leaders accountable by  incorporating apple values and key community  initiatives into our executive short-term  incentive plan.  competitive pay  apple is committed to remaining a market  leader in compensation through our highly  competitive and equitable programs. in  addition to our stock program and wide range  of benefits we provide, we regularly review our  competitive position to establish our leading  starting pay rates in each local market. apple stock ownership  in  , we introduced our stock ownership  program, which was designed to reach  employees who were not previously eligible for  restricted stock unit (rsu) awards, including  all of our retail and applecare teams. by the  end of  , over $ .  billion of rsu grants will  have been awarded under this program, and  the shares underlying the rsus today would  have an estimated value of over $  billion  (based on a share price of $ .  as of june   ,  ). apple is one of the few companies  in the s&p  , and the largest technology  company, in which employees at all levels are  eligible for rsu grants on an annual basis. in   ,  ,  employees were eligible for  rsu grants and our compensation committee  approved grants for  % of those eligible. in most countries, employees also get discounts  when purchasing apple stock by participating  in the employee stock purchase plan (espp).  currently,   percent of eligible employees  participate in the espp. esg modifier beginning in  , the compensation  committee incorporated the esg modifier  into the executive annual cash incentive  program. the esg modifier is based on a  holistic evaluation by the compensation  committee of key accomplishments and  actions taken during the year to advance  our apple values: accessibility, education,  environment, inclusion and diversity, privacy,  and supplier responsibility, and key community  initiatives which were chosen because they  represent long-standing, business-relevant  environmental, social, and governance  principles that reflect apple’s commitment to  promoting values-driven leadership. pay equity  since  , apple has achieved and maintained  gender pay equity for our employees worldwide.  in the u.s., we’ve also achieved pay equity with  respect to race and ethnicity — as well as pay  equity at the intersections of race and ethnicity  with gender.* in addition to our pay equity commitment,  our inclusion and diversity program (see  page   ) supports growth, development,  and engagement for team members of  all backgrounds. we have a number of practices in place  to support our commitment to pay  equity, including:  * pay equity at the intersections of race and ethnicity  with gender was achieved in  . appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     we encourage open and honest communication among team members, managers, and leadership as we seek to  build a better work environment for all. another way team members can let us know  how apple is doing is to participate in surveys  that we conduct regularly. these survey results  are a great way for us to learn about what’s  going well and how we can do better in areas  like career development, manager performance,  and inclusivity, and teams are encouraged to  create action plans based on the survey results. we conduct annual surveys for all apple store  and applecare team members to listen to their  views on topics like leadership, management,  career development, performance, values,  culture, and work environment. and leaders  from each organization use the survey insights  to take steps to better support team members  where they need it.  over the last two years in particular, we focused  on listening to apple store and applecare  employees as they were interacting most  directly with customers during the pandemic  and experiencing rapid change in how they  worked to support those customers. for our  early   surveys,   percent of apple store  team members and   percent of applecare   team members participated.annual compensation planning:  during our  annual compensation planning process, the  people team uses analytics to assess promotion  rates, performance ratings distribution, and pay  metrics for women compared to men and, in the  u.s., for underrepresented groups compared   to non-underrepresented groups. global compensation history policy:  we  don’t ask candidates for salary history during  the recruiting process, which has been our  policy globally since  . our recruiters  develop offers of employment based on the  compensation of current apple employees in  similar roles using a tool developed specifically  for this purpose.  engagement at apple, we believe that open and honest  communication among team members,  managers, and leaders helps create an open,  collaborative work environment where everyone  can contribute, grow, and succeed. across all our teams, we’re always building on  our long-standing commitment to creating an  environment where people at every level of the  company feel connected and supported. our  goal is to listen and learn — and to use those  lessons to build an even better workplace for all.  if team members have questions, feedback,  or concerns, they’re encouraged to share  them with their manager. if a team member is  ever uncomfortable raising a particular issue  with their manager, they can discuss it with  any manager at apple, their people business  partner, people support, or they can contact  the business conduct team. pay equity at apple our pay equity review is global and covers     percent of our employees. we consider  total compensation, including base salary,  bonus, and stock.  :   gender pay equity globally  :   pay equity in the u.s. by race  and ethnicity  :  gender pay equity in every country  :   pay equity in the u.s. at   the intersections of race   and ethnicity and genderannual pay equity review: to maintain pay  equity, we engage an independent third-party  expert to build and run statistical models to  assess and resolve any differences in total  compensation on the basis of gender and, in  the u.s., on the basis of race and ethnicity and  at the intersections with gender. job assessments:  apple’s dedicated  compensation team regularly conducts  comprehensive job title reviews to ensure that  employees are in the correct job title, which is  an important factor in determining pay. we also  continuously analyze market data to ensure  that compensation guidelines for all roles  remain competitive. empowering employees   to support the causes they   care about  our employee giving program provides  opportunities for employees to contribute  to the causes they care deeply about with  the support of apple. from volunteering to  donations to smaller individual actions, apple  is committed to giving, hand in hand with our  team members. read more on page   .apple has a no-retaliation policy. retaliation  against anyone who comes forward with a  concern or participates in an investigation is  grounds for termination. we respect each team  member’s right to form or join (or refrain from  joining) organizations of their choice in a lawful  manner without discrimination, retaliation,  or harassment. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     workplace practices  and policies  apple’s culture is built on treating everyone with  dignity and respect, and this focus shapes how our colleagues engage with one another and with our customers and partners around the world. we’re also committed to respecting our team members’ rights as set out in our human rights  policy . equal employment opportunity  apple is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity.  we take steps to provide equal opportunity for all applicants and employees, without regard to race, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, religion, creed, age (over  ), mental and physical disability, sex, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, military or protected veteran status, an employee’s reproductive health decisions or those of  their dependents, or on any other basis protected by law. we provide reasonable accommodations to applicants and employees with physical and mental disabilities. harassment and discrimination  we are committed to

voluntary decision review  apple’s voluntary decision review enables  employees t o have an employment d ecision  reevaluated. this is designed to promote  fairness and impartiality, in line with our values  and policies. the reviewer will consider any   new i nformation t hat i ndicates t he decision   may not have been in accordance with our  policies a nd g uidelines.  non-employees   and temporary workers in addition to our full-time employees,  temporary workers and vendor services play an  important role on our team. our temporary  workers generally p erform s imilar w ork as our  full-time employees, as they are intended to  augment t he apple employee  workforce  under   a short t o mid -term a ssignment. a pproximately   percent of our u.s. corporate workforce  were temporary workers as of october  . temporary workers have the same opportunity to be considered as all other applicants to any apple job posting whether that opportunity is a conversion of their current role or a role they found on our job site. and in our retail business, we have a strong record of hiring temporary workers as full- and part-time employees.  our outsourced services with workers provided  via vendors generally perform work that can be different from that performed by our permanent employees. this workforce is intended to support business needs where specific skills are required and the vendors have the ability  to scale with our varied business needs. pay and benefits: for vendor services, pay  rates are managed by the vendor. various benefits, including but not limited to healthcare, are offered to these workers through their employer or staffing agencies. vendors are also accountable to apple’s supplier code of conduct, which requires that our staffing agencies are compliant with all current local and national legislation and employment laws, including wage and benefits requirements, for their employees (see page    or people and  environment in our supply  chain ). raising concerns:  in many cases there are  multiple avenues for non-apple workers to report problems anonymously, including internal processes with their employer and the apple business conduct helpline (see page   ). performance:  vendor performance is  reviewed and evaluated by the vendor management based on feedback sometimes received from apple managers, procurement, and/or supplier responsibility. reporting a concern  at apple we believe strongly in a culture of open communication, mutual respect, and high  ethical standards — and we strive to do the right thing. it can be stressful if something at apple has a negative effect on well-being, violates an apple policy, or interferes with someone’s ability to do their best work. there are several ways team members can report a concern: managers:  talking to a manager is a good place to start. a large part of their responsibility  is to support their team members. if a team member is not comfortable bringing a concern  to their manager, they can discuss it with any manager at apple. people support:  this dedicated team specializes in supporting apple team members with  work-related topics. they can answer questions, clarify a policy, or suggest resources or  options to help resolve a problem.   business conduct:  team members can contact the business conduct team via phone,  email, or a third party. they will review the concern and share it with the appropriate internal  partners. read more on page   . people business partner:  team members can discuss the issue with their people  business partner (pbp), particularly if it’s related to your team or organization. team members are encouraged to raise their concerns in the way they feel most  comfortable, internally or externally. in addition to the options above, they may also contact any of the government agencies or other external organizations that address employee and workplace concerns. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     protecting each other’s health at every stage of the pandemic, our first  priority has always been the health of our  teams, customers, and communities. that  meant being one of the first companies to  close our offices and retail stores, and finding  innovative ways to connect with colleagues and  customers virtually. since  , we’ve continued our efforts and  programs to support our people. we adopted  cdc recommendations around up-to-date  vaccinations, including booster doses. apple  also continued to pay our teams during  temporary store and office closures, expanded  our paid leave policies, and enhanced our  policies and procedures for a safe work  environment — both in the office and in-store.to keep our teams informed, we deployed  comprehensive resources with up-to-date  covid-  information, including a dedicated  platform for teams returning to the office.  covid-  case support, implemented for  all team members, included return-to-work  guidance and contact tracing, with the utmost  regard for employee privacy. we continue to  offer special sick leave for employees with  possible covid-  symptoms, as well as  comprehensive health coverage. to continue to manage our response going  forward, we created a dedicated pandemic  response team in   in addition to the  cross-functional team that has been supporting  and guiding our covid response. the new  response team will support future pandemic  planning and response.innovating to support our customers despite all of the pandemic’s challenges, we  brought our hardware, software, and services  into customers’ hands, helping them stay  informed, connected, and entertained. we also tailored our services to promote easy  access to trusted information on covid- :  launching a dedicated section on apple news;  prioritizing visibility of essential services  locations — including covid-  testing and  vaccination locations — on apple maps;  offering a curated collection of telehealth apps  on the app store; and leveraging siri to provide  the latest covid-  guidance. to meet the extraordinary challenges of  virtual education, we delivered new content  and services for students, parents, and  teachers to foster creativity and learning  in a digital environment. we worked with  mobile carriers and school administrators  to deliver ipad devices with cellular support  for students in need. with our apple card  customer assistance program, we also offered  customers the option to skip their monthly  payments without incurring interest.  across many of our apple store locations,  we were able to serve our customers’  needs through contactless pickup, express  storefronts, and new online support. our  response to covid-  is still ongoing, and  we’re committed to implementing health  protocols and adjusting store operations as  required based on available data and guidance  from health officials.apple’s  covid-   response the health of our teams, customers, and communities continues to be our first priority. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     supporting people in our supply chain we are continuing to work together with our  suppliers to help them ensure that every  necessary precaution is taken to keep people  safe at work. in  , we introduced an  enhancement to our code and standards  specifically addressing infectious disease  preparedness and response (idpr). idpr  contains a set of new requirements resulting  from our learnings during the pandemic, which  will help our suppliers better prepare for and  be ready to respond to an infectious disease  outbreak at their facility. as part of the rollout  of idpr in fiscal year  , we conducted  more than   onsite and remote specialized  assessments to verify suppliers’ compliance  with covid-  control protocols in order to  drive improvement when necessary. we also continue to assess any existing gaps  at supplier facilities, and identify opportunities  to work with those in higher-risk areas to  help make their facilities safer. this includes  working with third-party suppliers to redesign  and reconfigure factory floor plans where  necessary, implementing flexible working hours  to maximize interpersonal space, implementing  enhanced deep cleaning protocols, and  deploying masks and sanitizers. in fiscal year   , we also encouraged our suppliers’  employees to get vaccinated and boosted  where available. we also partnered with ngos to help further  support supplier employees, as well as those  working deeper in our supply chain, particularly  those from vulnerable groups. we worked with  the international organization for migration  (iom) — the world’s leading organization  providing services to migrant workers — to  provide support to migrant workers impacted by the pandemic. with support from apple,  our long-time partner pact, an international  development organization, prepared and  coordinated activities to prevent the spread of  covid-  in several mining communities in the  democratic republic of the congo (drc). the  initiative has reached more than  ,  people  through individual and group dialogues on  covid-  prevention since the program began  in december  . giving back to our communities apple’s company-wide response to the  covid-  pandemic involved teams across  the business, including product design,  engineering, operations, packaging teams,  suppliers, and more. at the beginning of the  pandemic, when personal protective equipment  was in short supply, we sourced through our  supply chain and donated more than   million  masks for healthcare workers worldwide.  we also launched a company-wide effort to  produce and ship over   million face shields.  these face shields were delivered to sites  around the world, from new york presbyterian  hospital in the u.s. to the ministry of health  in zambia.  additionally, we have also donated over  $  million to the world health organization’s  covid-  solidarity response fund. we also  matched employee donations two-to-one to  support covid-  response efforts worldwide.  we awarded $  million from our advanced  manufacturing fund to copan diagnostics,  a market leader in sample collection kits,  that rapidly accelerated their ability to supply  sample collection kits to hospitals in the u.s.  for covid-  testing. and our partnership  with product (red) also supported covid-   response (see page   ). collaboration with our suppliers helps them make sure they’re taking every necessary  precaution to keep people safe at work. in partnership with the white house  coronavirus task force and the cdc, we  released an app and a website that guided  americans through a series of questions about  their health and exposure to determine if they  should seek care for covid-  symptoms,  providing cdc recommendations on next  steps, including guidance on social distancing  and self -isolating, how to closely monitor symptoms, recommendations on testing,  and when to contact a medical provider.  and we collaborated with google to create a  new exposure notification system for global  governments and health agencies, with user  privacy and security central to its design, to  help fight the pandemic. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     health and safety at apple  we’re dedicated to protecting our team  members and our customers everywhere  we operate — a responsibility covid-  has  brought into even greater focus. at every  stage of the pandemic, we’ve made decisions  based on the latest local data and public health  guidance, and we share lessons across our  environment, health, and safety (ehs) teams  globally so we can continuously improve our  safety programs.  protecting our people  we’re always working hard to make sure our  workers are safe no matter where they are  when they’re conducting business for apple.  we abide by ehs requirements in every country  where we operate and are dedicated to doing  everything we can to support the safety and  well-being of our global teams.  managing work-related hazards and risks  to help ensure the safety of our workers and  customers, we put procedures in place to  identify workplace risks and mitigate possible  hazards. we support and protect employees  in lower hazard spaces, and we put risk- specific programs in place for those working  in higher hazard environments, including safe  systems of work, chemical management,  laser safety, equipment and machinery safety,  hazardous materials management, and  electrical safety. employees can request to  have their workspaces individually inspected  to review hazards and controls, including  ergonomics evaluations. apple implements a hierarchy of control  for significant risks, which centers on  elimination, substitution, engineering controls,  administrative controls, and personal protective  equipment (ppe). as one example, apple ehs regularly assesses  hazards at our research labs based on their  chemical, equipment, laser, and other hazards.  approximately   percent of our labs are  considered “complex,” meaning that they  contain high-hazard processes and equipment.  these assessments help teams understand  which ehs programs and controls must be  put in place to mitigate risks. in  , apple  completed hazard assessments in over    research labs globally. our ehs teams identify and provide team  members with appropriate ppe for specific  hazards. this ppe is provided at no cost and  with training on correct use. for example,  our hearing conservation programs include  evaluation and control of occupational  exposures to noise, and hearing protection is  available for processes, areas, and tasks with  potential high noise exposures. additionally,  ehs conducts mandatory health checks for  employees where they’re needed. we invest in new technologies as we continue  to manage potential risks across our operations,  including our apple-owned manufacturing  sites. our standards, programs, trainings,  procedures, and other safeguards are managed  by trained ehs professionals, and where  required, we also translate ehs procedures into  local languages for our team members. risks identified from incidents, injuries, and  non-routine events are addressed expeditiously  to identify and implement appropriate  corrective and preventative actions, and we  integrate our learnings into future program  development and training. lessons learned  are routinely communicated across apple’s  ehs team and potentially affected operations,  and they are used to inform updates to existing  policies and procedures. employees and managers can report incidents,  near-misses, and observations — including  newly identified hazards and risks—through  an internal ios app. incident responses are  addressed by apple’s ehs team through a  consistent process that connects employees  with care and support, while identifying  corrective actions where appropriate to prevent  future occurrences.  waste management apple is committed to minimizing resource  use and the associated generation of non- hazardous or hazardous waste. where  possible, apple implements a waste hierarchy  of prevention, waste reduction at the source,  reuse of materials, recycling, energy recovery,  and landfilling as a last resort. we maintain our commitment to the safe and  responsible management of hazardous waste,  both onsite and offsite. any facility that does  not meet our requirements is replaced by  another approved waste management facility. we made progress in   at sites around  the world:u.s.:  thirteen of the treatment, storage, and  disposal facilities (tsdfs) we utilize in the u.s.  were audited in   to confirm that the waste  is treated, recycled, or incinerated within the  governing safety standards for health and the  environment. eight disposal facility reviews  were completed by vendors under apple  management, and we reviewed five other sites  via third-party audit reports. at one of our major  research labs in santa clara valley, the empty  container management program resulted in a    percent reduction of lab debris for hazardous  waste streams. united kingdom:  through an internal initiative  to further strengthen waste management,  product site-specific waste initiatives  achieved a   percent diversion from landfill  and a  .  tonnes of waste/ , both  exceeding requirements. ireland:  the cork campus is ecvp   zero  waste to landfill certified annually and has had  no material landfilled in the past five years. ergonomics in  , we continued to support our global  team members working from home office,  apple office, and non-office settings.  the apple ergonomics program is heavily  focused on preventative measures to reduce  the risk of work-related musculoskeletal  disorders (wmsds). this includes ergonomics  training sessions for our team members and  providing input into the purchase or design  of work equipment, systems, and facilities to  ensure that they meet ergonomic standards to  provide the best levels of efficiency, comfort,  health, and safety for anyone using them. our  appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     ergonomics trainings and self-assessment  support are aimed at creating an awareness  of ergonomic risk factors for wmsds, how to  prevent them, and how to proactively request  for adjustments to workstations.  we completed over  ,  individual support  requests for our team members working from  home, along with those who returned to apple  offices and apple store locations. support  included tailored guidance and feedback,  equipment recommendations, and  :  virtual  or in-person assessments. in addition, over    employees participated in various  training sessions.  our industrial, warehouse, and other non- office operations teams were supported with  approximately   ergonomic risk assessments  and   lab screenings. the assessments  evaluated risk factors such as repetition,  force, posture, and duration, while reviewing  the interaction of the team member with  new machines, equipment, work processes,  and workspaces. emergency preparedness and response  beyond covid- , we supported the response  to dozens of crisis events in  , including  fires, severe weather, and civil unrest. our  responses focused on the safety of our  employees and business continuity. we  activated   crisis management teams (cmts)  to manage the most severe events, and    additional incidents were supported without  full cmts.all team members can sign up for apple’s  emergency alert system, enabling them to be  notified of local emergencies and to indicate  whether they are safe or need help. disaster  supplies are available at our facilities. all apple  campuses with over   employees have  facility response and recovery plans, which  provide a comprehensive approach to the safety  and support of our employees while minimizing  business interruption. site-specific emergency  response plans have been implemented  globally. these plans are communicated to all  employees, and trainings and drills are held at  least annually. and our employees are trained  in emergency response, allowing them to react  quickly while supporting the safety of our team  members and customers.  in  , we completed over   emergency  response drills, which were supported by    trained emergency response team  (ert) members. we expect to increase the  frequency of these drills, depending on  covid-  restrictions.  with the care and support of our employees  and customers in mind, we deployed automatic  external defibrillator (aed) stations across  our global retail stores in  . and to ensure  that our team members could effectively use  this new tool, we provided aed training for our  team members. all campuses and key sites have disaster supplies  to match localized risks. as apple’s footprint  grows, sites are evaluated and supplies are  added as needed. as one example, in  , we  launched earthquake preparedness campaigns  for employees across the western united states  and japan. we conducted outreach to provide  employees with information, tools, and resources,  and we held drills in some offices. we’re always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when  they’re conducting business for apple.  appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     ehs management systems  to provide a safe and sustainable environment  for our teams, our ehs programs are built to  share information about risks, requirements,   and

suppliers operate. we work  closely with our suppliers to uphold the highest  standards so that the people in our supply  chain are safe and treated with respect, and  the environment is protected everywhere that  apple products are made. apple’s work in this space is led by apple  senior management. sabih khan is apple’s  senior vice president of operations, reporting  to coo jeff williams. sabih is in charge of  apple’s global supply chain, product quality,  and overseeing planning, procurement,  manufacturing, logistics, and product fulfillment  functions — the programs that support apple’s  environment and supply chain innovation work. the operations team also supports apple’s  environmental initiatives by partnering with  suppliers to propel green manufacturing, help  conserve resources, and protect the planet. holding ourselves and our suppliers   to the highest standards  as described on page   , our human rights  policy  outlines how we treat everyone, including  our customers, employees, business partners,  and people at every level of our supply chain.  we take a very broad view of our supply  chain (see diagram on page   ) — and the  responsibility that comes with it. we consider  our supply chain to include everything that  goes into designing, building, delivering,  supporting, and recycling of apple products,  as well as our retail stores and all of the services  and operations that are part of our supply  chain ecosystem. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     in the

unable or unwilling to  meet our code and standards. once new suppliers are awarded apple  business, we begin the process of helping them  quickly get up to speed on our requirements  through our supplier onboarding process.   in  , we expanded our onboarding process  to engage new suppliers at an even earlier  stage in their working relationship with apple.we also extend our support to help prospective  suppliers correct compliance issues found  during the procurement process — even when  the supplier is not awarded apple’s business  — at no cost to the participating companies.  since  ,   percent of companies that were  not awarded apple business elected to join this  voluntary program, helping to protect people and  the planet beyond the reach of our business and  supply chain. supplier engagement   and accountability we take a broad, comprehensive approach  to engaging with our suppliers to confirm that  our standards are met. one of the tools that  we employ are assessments. assessments,  also known as audits, are one of several  methods we use to measure compliance  with our requirements. these independent,  third-party assessments, which take place  onsite at supplier facilities, provide a snapshot  of a supplier’s performance. however, when  combined with regular engagement with  supplier teams, mandated reporting, and  listening directly to hundreds of thousands  of supplier employees about their workplace  experiences, our rigorous supplier assessments  provide a clear measure of their performance in  upholding our code and standards. in the   reporting period,   assessments  were conducted in   countries. this included    code of conduct assessments and    smelter and refiner assessments.  since  ,  apple-managed assessments have covered    percent of our direct manufacturing spend. the apple supply chain   million+  people thousands of businesses and facilities  countries our people and environment in our supply  chain report  (page  ) provides a detailed  overview of progress in our supply chain,  including efforts to identify, mitigate, prevent,  and remedy human rights risks as outlined by  the business and human rights due diligence  process set forth in the ungps. we work closely with many experts across  apple — from product and services designers  to facility managers — to evaluate and  update our code and standards annually to  address emerging risks, incorporate new legal  requirements and industry best practices, and  reflect the needs of supplier employees in a  dynamic operating environment. we engage with a range of stakeholders, including rights- holders, civil society organizations, academic  experts, and program partners, to ensure  that our code and standards reflect current  internationally recognized labor, human rights,  health and safety, and environmental standards.  upholding our values from the start we work across our business to implement our  standards from the earliest stages of product  design and development — from the suppliers  we choose to work with, to the materials in our  products, to the processes and equipment we  use to make them. we take a comprehensive

been taken to prevent a reoccurrence. we  prohibit retaliation of any kind against supplier  employees who participate in our assessments. our goal is to work together with suppliers to  help them improve their management systems,  rather than to simply remove them from our  supply chain without helping them correct the  issues we have discovered. in the event that a  supplier is unwilling or unable to improve their  operations to meet our requirements, they risk  removal from our supply chain. since  , we  have directed the removal of   manufacturing  supplier facilities and   smelters and refiners  from our supply chain for being unwilling or  unable to sufficiently improve their operations  to meet our requirements. results of our assessments are detailed in our  people and environment in our supply chain  report  beginning on page  . a responsibility that   grows with our business as apple’s business continues to grow and  expand to new areas, we adapt our supplier  engagement model accordingly. this includes  continuing to expand our scope to conduct  independent, third-party assessments of a  growing number of suppliers that support  our business outside of manufacturing. last  year, we increased our engagement and  expanded the application of our code and  standards to suppliers supporting newer areas  of apple’s business, including those that work

assessments were completed in fiscal year    at apple supplier sites. if we uncover non-compliance in the course  of any assessment or engagement, we take  prompt action so that suppliers not only correct  and remedy the issue, but make meaningful,  long-term changes to their systems and  processes. we do this through a corrective  action plan (cap), during which  -,  -, and   -day check-ins with apple are required.   we then conduct our corrective action  verification (cav) process to verify that all  corrective actions have been successfully  implemented, and necessary steps have code

to achieve progress at a more rapid pace. see  page   of the people and environment in our  supply chain report  for more detail on the  organizations we work with.labor and human rights   in the supply chain  people come first in everything we do. our  commitment to protecting the people in our  supply chain has been unwavering, anchored  by a simple set of beliefs: people deserve to be  treated with dignity and to know their rights.  they should be able to speak up if those rights  are not being respected — and to know and  expect that when they do, we will listen and act.  we’re committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain.we are committed to respecting the rights of  every individual in our supply chain — just like  we do for our team members, customers, and  other partners — and more broadly, to working  with others to share our tools and the lessons  we’ve learned, and to empowering everyone to  achieve progress more rapidly. listening to workers effective grievance channels, ongoing worker  management communications, and supplier  employee feedback are essential to ensuring  respect for worker rights and maintaining  safe and healthy workplaces. whether  through social dialogue and formal employee  representation, workplace satisfaction  surveys, anonymous hotlines, focus groups,  or interviews during annual assessments, the  feedback we receive directly from supplier  employees helps us ensure labor and human  rights are respected throughout our global  supply chain. we also use this feedback  to address emerging risks, improve rights  training for supplier employees and supplier  management, and to continually strengthen our  code and standards. • rights awareness:  we believe that  protection starts with rights awareness,  and since  , more than  .  million  supplier employees have been trained on  their workplace rights. under our code and  standards, suppliers are required to provide  employees with training on their workplace  rights. this training is generally conducted  during new employee orientation, and  covers international labor standards, local  labor laws, environmental health and safety,  and the protections required by our code  and standards• feedback channels: supplier employee  interviews are an important part of every  assessment conducted. each year, we  interview tens of thousands of supplier  employees in their local language and  without their managers present, to determine  whether or not their experience on the job  aligns with auditors’ observations during  assessments. in fiscal year  , despite  the ongoing challenges presented by  the covid-  pandemic, we interviewed   ,  workers in our supply chain — over   ,  more than were interviewed in the  previous fiscal year.   our code and standards require effective  worker feedback channels, including  grievance mechanisms, at all supplier sites.  we also provide third-party anonymous  hotlines, which are also available to our  employees (see page   ), and the ability to  contact the apple environment and supply  chain innovation (esci) team directly at any  time and in any language. when an issue is  raised, we require supplier management to  immediately investigate and to resolve the  issue in a timely manner.  in  , we launched a grievance hotline  awareness campaign, and its initial rollout  resulted in a   percent increase in utilization  of these third-party hotlines. the reports  we received from supplier employees via  hotlines in   included issues related to  wages and benefits, employee relations,  amenities at supplier facilities, workforce  stability, and health and safety. in each case,  we investigated and worked directly with the  suppliers to drive improvement and correct  any compliance issues found. suppliers  implemented a number of actions as a result  of supplier employee feedback through these  appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     channels, including improvements to working  hours, resignation processes, timing of  bonuses, and the use of personal protective  equipment (ppe). •  workplace satisfaction:  in addition to  interviews and grievance channels, we  also engage with supplier employees  to understand their overall workplace  satisfaction. in  , we anonymously  surveyed  ,  supplier employees in    facilities across greater china, india,  ireland, malaysia, philippines, singapore,  uk, u.s., and vietnam about their workplace  experiences — nearly double the number of  supplier employees surveyed last fiscal year.  as a result, suppliers took   actions,  including better commute options, increasing  wages and bonuses, offering better food  variety, and skill development opportunities  for entry-level managers. responsible labor recruitment our code and standards, and the protections  they provide, apply equally to all workers,  regardless of a person’s job, geographic  location, or how they enter our supply chain  — and this commitment begins even before  a worker ever enters our supply chain. this  includes zero tolerance for forced labor. we implement strict policies and procedures  with our suppliers to protect workers in our  supply chain from forced labor. this includes  selecting suppliers for assessments based  on factors, such as their geographic location,  which may put them at higher risk of forced  labor violations, as well as their previous  performance and/or history of violations or  allegations. suppliers may also receive additional  specialized assessments based on the nature  of their business or employee population, such  as those that employ foreign contract workers,  and those located in higher risk migration  corridors. our code and standards also require  that all supplier employees have an effective  mechanism to report grievances. in addition,  we provide third-party anonymous hotlines and  the ability to contact the apple environment and  supply chain innovation (esci) team directly at  any time and in any language. when an issue  is raised, supplier management is required to  promptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a  timely manner. we strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor  throughout our worldwide supply chain and look  for evidence of it in every supplier assessment  we conduct, including unannounced  assessments. last year, we conducted more  than   assessments, and found no instances  where anyone was forced to work in our  supply chain. we did discover two cases in taiwan in which  people paid recruitment fees to secure their  job, which is a violation of our code. we  required the supplier to directly repay their  employees in full, and verified repayment  through a third-party auditor. the payment of  recruitment fees, withholding an employee’s  passport or personal identity documents,  or restricting an employee’s freedom of  movement are core violations of our code  and standards — the most serious level of  code violations. if we discover workers have  paid recruitment fees at any point on their  employment journey to an apple supplier, we  require supplier management to take prompt  action to provide remedy to those affected  by directly repaying their workers for any and  all fees, even if the supplier was unaware  that their employees had paid recruitment  fees. from   through fiscal year  ,  our suppliers have repaid $ .  million in  recruitment fees directly to   ,  workers. finally, in collaboration with the international  organization for migration (iom) and the  responsible business alliance (rba), we  expanded our responsible labor recruitment  toolkit to more than   additional supplier  facilities in   countries, reaching nearly   ,   workers globally, with   percent of those  working on apple production lines. . m  supplier employees trained on their   rights since     ,  supplier employees

communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     how we   work to  prevent forced  labor in our  supply chain apple has zero tolerance for forced  labor. in the more than   countries  and regions where our suppliers  operate, we have teams of experts,  including independent third parties,  who monitor our suppliers and put in  place industry-leading procedures  to help ensure that no one is forced  to work. our comprehensive policies  start before we even sign a contract  with suppliers, and we are consistently  raising the bar.   we set the highest standards.   eliminating forced labor begins with setting  and maintaining the highest standards. our  standards often go above and beyond legal  requirements to protect people from forced  labor risks.  we engage early.   to address forced labor risks at its roots,   we know that our work has to begin before  people enter our supply chain.  we hold suppliers accountable.   once we’ve implemented thorough  preventative measures, independent,  third-party assessments verify that our  suppliers are meeting our standards.  looking for evidence of forced labor is part  of every supplier assessment. if we find any  violations of our code and standards, we  take swift action to remedy the issue and  improve their operations.   we track progress   and report transparently.   consistent improvement requires  transparency and accountability. since   , we have been publishing reports  on our efforts across all of our work  to transparently share our progress  and challenges.   we regularly engage and   partner with stakeholders.   engagement with stakeholders and rights  holders is critical to accountability, ensuring  we’re taking action where it’s needed, and to  achieving rapid progress.   aligning with international frameworks.   apple policies and our supplier requirements align with  international labor and human rights standards, including those  of the international labour organization, the united nations  guiding principles on business and human rights (ungps), and  the organisation for economic co-operation and development.  the apple human rights policy   our human rights policy outlines how we treat everyone,  including our customers, employees, business partners,   and the people across every level of our supply chain.   read the apple human rights policy   the apple supplier code of conduct and supplier  responsibility standards   our supplier requirements contain strict standards for  responsible labor recruitment, and apply to all suppliers,  protecting workers globally. we go above and beyond legal  requirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor  recruitment in regions where we cannot conduct adequate   due diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy,  because we believe no one should pay to secure a job.    read the apple supplier code of conduct   and supplier responsibility standards thorough mapping informs our strategy.   an effective strategy requires deep understanding of our  supply chain. to date, we have mapped over   labor  recruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across    countries.  a leading strategy requires leading tools.   the apple responsible labor recruitment toolkit, developed  in partnership with the international organization for  migration, provides suppliers and their labor agencies with  easy-to-use tools that help them effectively manage and  report data, mitigating forced labor risks before people even  enter our supply chain. in addition to providing hands-on  training, we are making these tools openly available for others  to use.  awareness is power.   we require our suppliers to provide their employees with  training on their workplace rights on their first day on the  job. this helps to ensure that every person is aware of  their rights and what to do if they’re not being respected,  which includes the ability to anonymously contact apple  directly. foreign contract workers, who make up a very  small percentage of people in our supply chain, also receive  training prior to leaving their home country, as well as upon  arriving in their destination country. to date, our suppliers  have provided workplace rights training to over  .  million  people. in addition, last year we directly engaged with over   ,  people in our supply chain to learn more about their  workplace experience.   investing in consistent improvement.   through our new supplier employee development fund,  we’re investing $ m to expand programs designed  to continue to improve the rights training experience,  worker voice platforms, and supplier employee education  opportunities. a close look.   we regularly conduct independent, third-party assessments,  including surprise assessments, of our suppliers, verifying  compliance with over   points across our standards. this  includes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring  and personnel records are in place and accurate. in addition  to specialized forced labor assessments for at-risk suppliers,  we also require many suppliers to participate in facility-wide  assessments, such as the validated assessment program,  to verify performance across the supplier’s entire business.  in the event that we find gaps in a supplier’s compliance  or capabilities, we require them to implement a corrective  action plan. to date, our assessments have covered    percent of our direct manufacturing spend.   we investigate every report.   in addition to thoroughly assessing our suppliers’ performance  in upholding our standards, we also receive reports from the  press, governments, civil society, and people in our supply  chain, and we encourage the public to report concerns via  https://www.apple.com/uk/supplier-responsibility/. we  investigate every report, and frequently have apple teams  onsite within   hours.   swift action and steep penalties.   forced labor in any form is a core violation (the most serious  violation level) of our requirements. if a core violation is  discovered, the supplier’s ceo is notified and the supplier  is immediately placed on probation, pending the successful  completion of a corrective action plan. probation can include  no new projects, no new business, and termination of existing  business. in addition to commercial penalties, if a supplier is  unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they risk removal  from our supply chain. since  , we have directed the  removal of   manufacturing

standards  cover the safe handling of chemicals,  emergency preparedness, health and safety  permits, living and working conditions, and  incident management. health and safety is  also an important part of every assessment we  conduct. any instances of noncompliance with  our code and standards during an assessment  are addressed through customized corrective  action plans, online training materials, and  capability building with ehs experts in order  to improve their future performance. in  ,  we began development of a safety culture  guide to help suppliers cultivate a deeper, more  sustainable culture of safety in their facilities.  health and wellness beyond keeping people in our supply chain  safe, we’re committed to creating workplaces  where people can thrive. this means giving our  supplier employees the tools and resources to  improve their physical and mental health and  well-being. since  , we’ve helped make health  education and resources available to more than   .  million supplier employees on topics such as reproductive health, disease prevention,  and nutrition. in  , we conducted a needs  assessment to give supplier employees an  opportunity to share their feedback, and we  are updating our resources with those results  in mind.  safeguarding health   through safer chemistry our commitment starts with setting and  upholding strict material safety standards  that often go beyond regulatory requirements  in order to protect human health and the  environment. these are outlined in our code  and standards and our regulated substances  specification (rss), and are derived from  international laws or directives, regulatory  agencies, eco-label requirements, and  environmental standards. we then go further,  by intentionally designing

the apple education hub will  provide a scalable solution through virtual- first learning, to promote and develop the  skills necessary for the future of work in our  supply chain and surrounding communities.  with initial programming to begin in the  apple’s $  million supplier employee development fund will expand access to learning opportunities and skills  development for people across its supply chain.using our purchasing power for good for apple, our work to make our company more inclusive extends to how we  choose the businesses we work with. when contracting with suppliers, we use our  purchasing power to increase diversity in our supply chain and change outdated  norms that hurt those who are underrepresented in their field or industry.  apple’s award-winning supplier diversity program, established in  , actively  engages suppliers from historically underrepresented communities.  we have policies and procedures that require diverse supplier participation during  early-stage sourcing, key performance indicators to measure company success,  and diversity awareness trainings for our global sourcing team members and related  apple business units.  in  , apple was the first silicon valley–based company to be invited   into the billion dollar roundtable (bdr) in recognition of our long-standing   commitment to promoting diversity within our supplier base. bdr celebrates  corporations that achieved spending of at least $  billion with minority- and   woman-owned businesses.  in calendar year  , apple spent over $ .  billion with diverse suppliers around the  world. our supplier diversity program offers support to participating suppliers and  seeks active engagement in industry diversity leadership activities. for example,  supplier development has been a long-standing commitment within apple’s supply  chain, which is facilitated internally and externally. externally, we partner with major  universities to provide executive development and capacity building to key diverse  suppliers. and we’re proud to have supported michigan state university and  howard university on creating their first programs for diverse supplier development. a highlight of   was that for the first time we engaged diverse suppliers   in north america in manufacturing accessories for some of apple’s most well- known products.  we’re also promoting diversity in the companies with which we do business.  for example, our agreements with our primary construction suppliers require  the reporting of their efforts to include diverse subcontractors on all apple- related projects.  as a result of our efforts, we were chosen as corporation of the year by the national  minority supplier development council (nmsdc) in october  . this award is  nmsdc’s highest honor to a major corporation for the utilization of ethnic minority- owned suppliers, specifically those with asian-indian, asian-pacific, black,  hispanic/latinx, and indigenous owners. appendix

training and technical certifications,  to classes on coding, robotics, and advanced  manufacturing fundamentals. internal leadership   and technical programs we work consistently to provide meaningful  educational opportunities that enrich supplier  employees’ workplace experiences and provide  opportunities to improve career paths. over the  past five years, more than   students have  participated in our line leader, automation  technician, and general apprenticeship  programs. these programs give participants  the skills they need to pursue opportunities in  highly technical roles. in  ,   supplier  employees at   supplier sites participated  in technical training, including programs on  robotics, computer numerical control (cnc)  machines, and mobile device repair. coding  since  , we’ve offered training to supplier  employees on apple’s swift coding language  — a skill that is in high demand. in  , we  continued to build on feedback from students  and suppliers to refine our curriculum by adding  more opportunities for virtual learning while  maintaining the quality and consistency of  the programs.environment human rights and environmental protection  are inextricably linked. and we’re taking action  accordingly. as we build products that enrich  the lives of people around the world, we have  a profound responsibility to do so in a way that  minimizes our resource use while protecting the  local environments and communities where we  and our suppliers operate. we work with our suppliers to help us address  our environmental commitments, including our  goal to become carbon neutral by   across  our entire product footprint. our supplier energy  efficiency program and supplier clean energy  program both address direct and indirect  emissions in our supply chain, while our supplier  clean water and zero waste programs help to  reduce resource usage. in addition, our code contains strict  environmental protections, which require our  suppliers to understand and take active steps  to reduce their environmental impact while also  becoming better stewards of the resources  we all share and the communities in which  we operate. specifically, our code addresses  the management of regulated substances,  stormwater, wastewater, air emissions, waste,  and noise, as well as pollution prevention,  resource reduction, and obtaining necessary  environmental permits. more detail about our environment work in the  supply chain is covered on page   , as well as  in people and environment in our supply chain  report  and the environmental

everyone. and wherever we meet  our customers — online, over the phone, or in person — we’re committed to treating  everyone with dignity and respect.  we believe that technology should be a force for good in the world. it’s why we  partner with students and educators using technology to teach and learn in new  ways, and collaborate with doctors and researchers to uncover new insights that help  people live healthier lives. every day, we work to infuse the technology we make with  the values that define us. responsibility for integrating privacy,  accessibility, inclusion, education, and health  into our products and services cuts across  many teams, including hardware engineering,  software engineering, hardware technologies,  machine learning and ai, and environment,  policy and social initiatives. because we care about our customers, we  also have programs in place to understand and  support their needs. we work to provide positive  customer experiences as well as products  that are durable and can be used for years to  come. and when we design our products, we’re  focused on making them safe for anyone who  assembles, uses, or recycles them.privacy privacy is a fundamental human right, and  we’re constantly innovating to give users more  transparency and control over their data. it’s  why we set the industry standard for minimizing  data collection and processing a user’s  data on-device, and build industry-leading  transparency and controls into our technology.our approach delivering exceptional products that enrich  the lives of our customers is core to apple’s  business. we have enormous potential to help  people use technology to overcome barriers  to their goals, innovate to solve problems, and  expand access to critical needs like health

products and services help  our customers learn, express their creativity,  exercise their ingenuity, communicate privately  and securely, and share information globally,  whether by text message, audio, or sign  language over facetime video. designed for privacy our products and services are built with  innovative privacy technologies and techniques  designed to minimize how much of your data  apple — or anyone else — can access. they  contain features designed and implemented  over decades to protect customers’ privacy   and give them control over their information.safari was the first browser to block third- party cookies by default as far back as  ,  and in  , safari added intelligent tracking  prevention to further limit tracking while  still enabling websites to function normally.  random identifiers ensure that routes  customers take and the places they search  in maps are not associated with their apple  id, and messages and facetime are end-to- end encrypted, so apple can’t eavesdrop on  user communications. siri was designed from  the very beginning in   to not associate  the things that users say to siri with their  apple id, but instead uses a random identifier  generated when a user first enables siri. that  has remained the same since then, and in   , with newly introduced on-device speech  recognition, the audio of users’ siri requests  is processed right on their iphone or ipad  by default. throughout the app store ecosystem, we  continue to add innovative new features that  advance user privacy even further. privacy  nutrition labels require developers, including  apple, to report their data collection and  privacy practices in a standardized format. and  app tracking transparency requires developers  to obtain a user’s permission to track their  data across apps or websites owned by other  companies for use in advertising or shared with  data brokers. apple’s privacy policy ensures that privacy  remains a top priority in all that we do. our  suppliers are also obligated to apply our privacy  principles via our contractual terms. we respect  users’ ability to know, access, change, transfer,  restrict, and delete personal data, and we  strive to collect the minimum amount of data  necessary to power our products and services. customers control what information is shared,  where it’s shared, and when it’s backed up.  we do not provide user information to any  third parties without a clear legal basis, and  we publish a transparency report  detailing  government requests for customer data and  app removal. users can exercise their privacy rights at  our dedicated data and privacy page,   privacy.apple.com , where they can receive  a copy of the personal data that apple holds on  them across all of their interactions with us and  request deletion or temporary deactivation of  their account if they wish. apple is committed to delivering advertising in a  way that respects user privacy. apple -delivered  ads may appear on the app store, apple news,  and stocks depending on the jurisdiction.  the apple advertising platform does not track  users, nor does it buy or share user personal  information with other companies. to continue raising awareness and educating  people on how to protect their personal  information, on data privacy day in january    we shared a report that illustrates how  companies track user data across websites  and apps. and in june   we shared another  report exploring how apple’s security layers  and the app review process protect users and  keep them in control of their

including privacy  by design and encryption. privacy inquiries privacy questions, concerns, or complaints can  be raised online or by calling our apple support  number. our data protection officer is available  for questions regarding the privacy policy or  general privacy practices. embedding security and privacy we’ve spoken out, time and again, for strong  encryption without backdoors, recognizing  that security is the foundation of privacy. we  build security into our hardware, software,  and services, including at the design and  development phase, to provide users with  maximum security and a transparent user  experience, serving the ultimate goal of keeping  personal information safe. and we’ve designed  the secure enclave — a dedicated secure  subsystem integrated into apple hardware  — to keep sensitive user data, like biometric  information, secure.as part of our commitment, our apple security  bounty rewards researchers who discover  and share with us critical issues in our latest  operating systems and the techniques used  to exploit them.  apple also uses administrative, technical, and  physical safeguards to protect users’ data,  taking into account the nature of that information  and the threats posed. apple employees who  handle personal information are only permitted  to use approved software and collaboration  tools. our employees handling personal data  are required to undergo dedicated privacy  training, which is updated on an ongoing basis  to take into account new laws and privacy  developments. all our employees can raise  any privacy issues and questions with our  data protection officer, who is mandated to  raise any issues of concern to apple’s privacy  steering committee. when we become aware of a potential  data

original content  includes audio descriptions in dolby atmos  in nine languages, and closed captions and  subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing in  over   languages in all  + countries where  apple tv+ is available. vision our features for blind and low-vision users  include voiceover, an industry-leading screen  reader that describes exactly what’s happening  on your device, and zoom, a screen magnifier  that lets you enlarge the content you see on  your device. magnifier, apple’s built-in app  for iphone and ipad, turns the camera into a  digital magnifying glass to increase the size of  any physical object you point it at. the people  detection feature in magnifier uses camera,  lidar scanner, and on-device machine  learning to help support health and safety for  users who are blind or have low vision and need  to maintain social distancing.  hearing to support customers who are deaf or hard of  hearing , apple was the first to directly connect  hearing aids or a cochlear implant to iphone  and other ios devices through the made for  iphone (mfi) program. this enables customers  to make phone calls and stream high-quality  audio directly to their mfi hearing devices. and  in  , apple added support for the latest  generation of bidirectional hearing aids from  made for iphone partners that support hands- free phone and facetime conversations.  sound recognition notifies users of external  environmental sounds like running water, alarms, electrical appliances, breaking glass,  and more, with the newly introduced option  to train your iphone or ipad to listen for a  specific alarm or electrical appliance sound.  other features include live captions (beta),  introduced in  , which helps users with  hearing disabilities follow along with calls and  media on iphone, ipad, and mac; sign language  prominence in facetime, which can detect  when someone uses sign language in group  calls; and conversation boost for airpods pro,  which helps users better hear conversations in  crowded or noisy environments.  mobility users with limited mobility can use switch  control to navigate their device with a variety  of switches, including head-tracking, back  tap, sound actions, and certified mfi switches.  voice control helps a user control a device  with voice commands across iphone, ipad,  and mac. on apple watch, assistivetouch

with quadriplegia or other  physical and motor disabilities in controlling  apple watch via iphone using assistive features  such as switch control and voice control.  ipados supports third-party eye-tracking  devices, making it possible for people to  control ipad using just their eyes. with touch  accommodations, customers can control  how long they touch the screen before it’s  recognized and whether repeat touches are  ignored, while back tap lets users double- tap or triple-tap the back of their iphone to  automatically perform a range of custom tasks,  from opening an app to taking a screenshot.cognitive our products are built with an array of features  to support people who are neurodivergent or  have cognitive disabilities. background sounds  help minimize distractions and support users  who want to focus, stay calm, or rest. with  speak selection for ios and macos, audio  can be used to support reading or writing  comprehension, and dictation and siri help  anyone who finds speaking easier than typing  or writing. another feature, guided access,  limits a device to a single app and lets users  control which features are available. the people detection feature in magnifier uses the lidar camera in iphone   pro, iphone   pro, and ipad pro to  help support health and safety for users who are blind or have low vision and need to maintain social distancing. community support apple offers extensive support documentation ,  engaging online training content , and in-store  sessions  to help anyone learn how to use our  built-in accessibility features.

 for inclusion in work done for, by, and with  persons with disabilities. in addition to hiring  people with disabilities to develop and inform  our accessibility features, we welcome all users  to beta test features and give feedback.we work with various nonprofit organizations  around the globe to strategically align and  support each other, and we maintain constant  contact with community organizations to  help ensure that we are exceeding their  expectations. we also work with international  standards organizations to expand equal  access to information and functionality while  working to protect and improve the rights,  inclusion, and equity of people with disabilities.  apple follows policy developments and shares  its best practices with regulators, governments,  and organizations, including the world health  organization (who) and the european  disability forum (edf). working with the world federation of the  deaf, the american council of the blind, the  cerebral palsy foundation, and the national  association of the deaf, apple proposed the  adoption of accessibility-themed emoji to  the unicode consortium, the global body in  charge of setting character standards across all  computing platforms. in  , the consortium  adopted apple’s recommendation for more  inclusive and representational emoji. and in   , we expanded the accessibility options for  memoji to include cochlear implants, an oxygen  tube, and a soft helmet. inclusive design building on our accessibility work, we’ve  always believed that in order to create the most  personal technology in the world, we must  consider the full range of human experiences.  all across apple there is a sustained  commitment to making products more inclusive  for a wide range of diverse groups. apple engineers work hand in hand with teams across  the business to help solve unique problems  others seldom think about.  for example, with ios  . , siri no longer has a  default voice, allowing users to choose the voice  that speaks to them when they first set up their  device, and in english, users can now select  more diverse voice options. we’re also taking  steps to ensure equity in our cameras’ automatic  person recognition features so that everyone  can have the same extraordinary experience,  no matter the photographic subject’s skin color,  age, or gender. as a result, the machine learning  models used in camera technology must show  similar performance across various age groups,  genders, ethnicities, skin tones, and other  attributes. we’ve also published  research   on this work  to help others learn from it. beyond our own products and services,  we’ve developed machine learning research   and human interface guidelines  to support  developers in building inclusive apps that  put people first by prioritizing respectful  communication and presenting content and  functionality in ways that everyone can access  and understand. some of the characteristics  to consider include age, gender and gender  identity, race and ethnicity, language and culture,  and social and economic context, among  others. we also provide tools, documentation,  sample code, and design best practices  to help  developers make their apps more accessible.  we launched two videos during our worldwide  developers conference (wwdc) in june    on the process and practice of inclusive  design that were among the most popular of the  week: the process of inclusive design  and the  practice of inclusive  design .a preview of innovative accessibility features combining   the power of hardware, software, and machine learning in may  , we previewed software features coming later this year that offer users  with disabilities new tools for navigation, health, communication, and more. using  advancements across hardware, software, and machine learning, people who are blind   or low vision can use their iphone and ipad to navigate the last few feet to their destination  with door detection; users with physical and motor disabilities who may rely on assistive  features like voice control and switch control can fully control apple watch from their  iphone

data with a loved  one, a caregiver, and, in the u.s., their doctor  through the health app. health research everything apple does in health is based  in science. we have a history of enabling  the medical community through platforms  like researchkit and carekit, which help  researchers produce medical insights and  discoveries on conditions from epilepsy  to parkinson’s at a pace and scale never  seen before. apple technology is helping democratize  medical research by giving users the ability   to opt in to share data through the research  app using their iphone or apple watch. there  are currently three public landmark studies   in the research app: apple women’s health study: the harvard  t.h. chan school of public health has teamed  up with apple and the national institute of  environmental health sciences to gain a deeper  understanding of how certain demographic  and lifestyle factors could have an impact on  menstrual cycles and gynecologic conditions,  including infertility, menopause, and polycystic  ovary syndrome. see the latest updates . apple hearing study:  the apple hearing  study is a partnership between the university  of michigan and apple to study sound  exposure and its impact on hearing health.  this groundbreaking study helps advance  our understanding of how hearing could be  impacted over time by exposure to sound at certain levels. the study data is also being  shared with the world health organization as a  contribution to its make listening safe initiative.  see the latest updates . apple heart and movement study:   conducted in collaboration with the american  heart association and brigham and women’s  hospital, the apple heart and movement  study explores factors that affect heart  health and potentially cause deterioration in  mobility or overall well-being, in an effort to  promote healthy movement and improved  cardiovascular health. by collecting heart  health, workout, mobility, and activity data  from apple watch and iphone users, as well as  survey data, this study will provide insights on  heart health and potential early warning signs   in ways that were not possible before.   see the latest updates . partnering with the medical industry our technology gives healthcare providers  the tools they need to work effectively within  hospitals and connect remotely with patients.  apps on ipad, iphone, and

shopping experience beyond our  own retail locations and the apple website. listening and improving to help ensure quality, we continually monitor  customer feedback, assess key drivers, and  leverage analytics to improve the customer  experience. customer feedback is shared  with team members as well as leaders, so that  everyone understands their impact and is  focused on making the customer experience  the best it can possibly be. throughout the  pandemic, our retail teams continue to work  diligently to be flexible through ever-changing  operational challenges, as well as health and  government guidelines. all the while they keep  the focus on helping our customers, and as a  result our store teams earned our highest-ever  customer satisfaction scores. as we continue delivering exceptional  products, we remain committed to high-quality  standards and transparent communication  with customers. we maintain a system status  page to actively report on identified system  issues and offer service programs to address  hardware issues. we encourage our customers  to contact us with questions, provide feedback,  or request support. as just one example, learn  more  about how we responded to customer  feedback on airtag.safety for children and families  families love iphone, ipad, mac, apple watch,  and apple tv because they are some of the  most powerful tools ever made for learning,  exploring, and staying in touch. we’re committed  to providing tools that let caregivers know, and  feel good about, what kids are doing. a range of  features offer flexibility to track app usage, set  limits on screen time and community, choose  which apps children can use, and manage the  content and websites they can access. features also help protect kids from what they  see and send. with the latest versions of ios,  ipados, and macos, families can set up kids’  devices to show warnings when receiving or  sending images containing nudity. the image  is blurred, and the child gets an alert along with building durability and repairability   into our designs designing and building durable hardware is  core to delivering this customer experience.   we assess our designs against our strict  durability standards through testing methods  that mimic realistic conditions in which our  customers use their products. every aspect  of our products is thoroughly assessed by  engineers in our reliability testing lab who  measure the performance of materials,  components, and fully assembled products. we continue to design our products with  features that enhance repairability and  durability. for instance, we’ve continued   to increase the number of repairable modules  on iphone while also adding durability features  like water resistance.  making repairs more convenient if a repair is needed, we believe our customers  should have convenient access to quality   repair services to get their product back up   and running as quickly as possible. over the past three years, we’ve nearly doubled  the number of service locations with access  to genuine apple parts, tools, and training,  offering more ways for consumers to get  repairs. these repair options include apple  store locations, apple authorized service  providers (aasp), participating independent  repair providers, mail-in repair centers, or  onsite service and, starting in  , self  service repair. our repair network has grown  to over   aasp locations and over    independent repair providers around the world  — in addition to our   apple retail locations.visit our families site

with  unsafe situations. for example, users who ask  siri how they can report child exploitation will   be pointed to resources for where and how   to file a report. product longevity  we believe long-lasting products are best for  the environment. we also believe products that  minimize the need for repair or replacement  encourage our customers to come back to  apple. we design our products with this goal  in mind. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     apple’s safety compliance policy defines  procedures to monitor products in the field and  investigate potential safety issues. this policy  requires escalation of safety issues to apple  management and timely reporting to regulators  where necessary. it also requires mechanisms  for employees to confidentially report safety  or compliance concerns, as well as training for  employees on how to address the concerns.  our product integrity and legal teams are  responsible for ensuring that apple’s safety  compliance policy is followed.we collect devices for refurbishing and reuse  through several programs, including apple  trade in, the iphone upgrade program,  applecare, and our corporate hardware  reuse program. in fiscal year  , we sent   .  million devices and accessories to new  owners for reuse. our trade in program extends  to   countries, providing customers with  options for product end-of-life — to access  the value of their current device if they want to  upgrade to a newer model, or to recycle their  devices for free. product safety we design our products to make sure they’re  safe for anyone who assembles, uses, or  recycles them. commitment to safety  the well-being of those who design, make, use,  and recycle our products is a priority for apple,  which is why we’re committed to using safer  materials to create safer products. we assess  the health and safety of all our products, during  every stage of their life cycle — from early  concept development, through use, service,  and repair, to recycling. during the design and  prototyping process, cross-functional apple  teams analyze potential failures and their  effects from a quality and safety perspective.  the results drive product design improvements  and manufacturing process controls. apple is committed to helping customers  understand how to safely use apple  products. apple’s product user manuals   include important safety and handling  information, and apple offers additional topical  content to provide tips and help customers  understand features. for example, apple published articles to make  sure customers with potential skin sensitivities   understand what materials are used in  our wearable products. we also explained  how to clean and disinfect  apple products,  and provided guidance on keeping apple  products with magnets a safe distance from  medical devices. safety compliance  apple’s products are designed, tested, and  certified to comply with international and  regional safety standards. they also meet our  own specifications, which often go above and  beyond what is required. for example, apple’s  regulated substances specification restricts  the use of certain chemical substances in apple  products, and we apply rigorous additional  controls for materials that may have prolonged  contact with the skin. components that are  critical to safety are subject to enhanced  requirements and additional supplier audits. apple tracks customer reports of potential  product safety issues, and employees  are trained on how to handle, document,  and properly escalate such reports. apple  investigates reported incidents and also  analyzes products for potential safety issues.   in the rare event that apple determines a  product poses a potential safety risk, we take  action to recall the product, which includes  notifying customers and helping customers  have their products repaired, replaced,  or refunded. apple products also help customers in emergencies   and in caring for their well-being, with features like  emergency calling, fall detection, medical id, and  hearing health notifications.  keeping our products current   with software updates apple provides free software upgrades to  improve our customers’ experience and help  our products last longer. our customers can  count on the latest software features and  security updates to their existing devices for  years. we continually improve the operating  systems that power our products and engineer  each software release to run seamlessly on all  supported devices. extending the life of products and parts  through refurbishment and reuse we can lower the impact each device has on  the environment — including carbon intensity  per year of life — by finding ways to refurbish  and reuse these products. and by building our  products to serve more than one owner and  encouraging customers to exchange devices  for an upgrade, we extend the life   of our products.now available: self service repair self service repair became available in april   , providing repair manuals and genuine  apple

northridge’s global hsi equity innovation hub   as part of our racial equity and justice initiative.racial equity and  justice initiative we have an urgent responsibility to help  dismantle systemic racism and support  opportunities for black, hispanic/latinx, and  indigenous communities. our racial equity  and justice initiative (reji) is focused on three  key areas: expanding access to education,  supporting criminal justice reform, and  removing economic barriers for communities  of color. the initiative began in june   with an  initial commitment of $  million, followed  by an additional $  million commitment in  august  , to help elevate equity-focused  solutions across the academic and advocacy  landscapes, and a $  million commitment  in may   to expand access to capital for  community financial institutions supporting  communities of color. reji has spurred new partnerships and projects  while inspiring us to weave a focus on equity  and justice into everything we do — including  our existing community programs   and business operations. education: greater access   and greater opportunity reji builds on our long-standing commitment  to education and works hand in hand with our  community education initiative ( page   ).  historically black colleges and universities  (hbcus), hispanic-serving institutions (hsis),  and tribal colleges and universities (tcus)  are critical leaders in expanding educational  access, as are community colleges and other  centers of learning. to support their continued leadership, apple is collaborating with minority- serving institutions on programs designed to  build a more inclusive workforce. propel center:  in january  , apple, in  collaboration with southern company and  a range of community stakeholders, helped  launch the propel center, a global innovation  and learning hub for the hbcu community.  the propel center supports hbcu students  and faculty through a robust virtual platform,  a physical campus in

also support the un  sustainable development goals, including goal    on access to education, goal   on decent  jobs, and goal   on reducing inequality (see  appendix page   ). community education initiative inspired by the impact of our connected  initiative  and programs like everyone  can create and everyone can code, we  launched our community education initiative  (cei) in   with a focus on expanding  learning opportunities in communities  that are historically underrepresented and  underresourced in technology.  cei partners with k–  and higher education  institutions, community-based organizations,  and nonprofits to bring coding, creativity,  and workforce development opportunities to  educators and learners of all ages. cei aims to  build knowledge and skills for high-demand,  high-growth technical careers alongside  communities that have been traditionally  underresourced to advance education equity.  our support includes hardware grants,  monetary grants to support scholarships and  programming, resources for educator training,  curriculum development, and employee  engagement opportunities.through educational partnerships across  the u.s., we’ve been able to reach tens  of thousands of students and educators  who might not have had access to our  technology and education resources. as of  april  , we’ve supported and partnered  with   education institutions and nonprofit  organizations — including   hbcus — in over    different locations across   states in the  u.s. and four locations across the uk since the  initiative launched in  . grounded in the positive relationships that  we’ve established with these organizations,  we’re working to deepen our impact in  three areas: educator development:  we’re providing  educator development and training  opportunities to build the knowledge and  skills that educators need to teach coding  in underrepresented communities through  teacher coding academies and the cei  learning series. these programs allow  hundreds of teachers from around the u.s.  to meet virtually and in person to share  best practices for integrating and teaching  coding and creativity concepts. through  our academies and cei learning series,  we’re connecting cei educators with apple  distinguished educators from all around the  world. apple distinguished educators lead and  participate in learning workshops, along with  our apple professional learning specialists. out-of-school-time learning:  we’re  partnering with nonprofits, ngos, and  community-based organizations that provide  out-of-school-time learning experiences  to increase exposure, awareness, and  experiences through coding and creativity.   a new collaboration between apple and boys & girls clubs of america will bring coding  with swift to tens of thousands of young learners across the country.  appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     support for minority-serving institutions:   we’re especially focused on expanding our  engagement with minority-serving institutions,  including hbcus, hsis, and tcus, as well as  community colleges and public schools in  underserved communities. in  , many of our cei projects were  undertaken in support of reji’s education  focus ( page   ). for example, in december   , apple and boys & girls clubs of america  launched a new collaboration to bring coding  with swift to tens of thousands of students  across the u.s., building on apple’s existing  partnership with the organization to use  ipad and apple’s free everyone can code  curriculum. and in canada, we’ve supported  learning for indigenous people through an app- based literacy assessment tool, which drove  significant literacy outcomes, encouraged a  community-based approach, and provided  learning activities for children to build oral skills.  in addition, we partnered with the assembly  of first nations on an interactive collection of  apple books that explore canadian history   from an indigenous perspective. apple developer academy as the ios app economy continues to grow,  we’re investing in educational programs and  opportunities that prepare learners of all ages  and backgrounds for the jobs of the future. in  , we started the apple developer  academy to empower entrepreneurs, creators,  and coders by helping them cultivate the skills  necessary to pursue new career opportunities.  the program focuses on communities with  high youth unemployment and is open to  anyone, regardless of academic background  or experience. we seek to spark interest among the next generation of developers and  bring diverse representation to the growing  app ecosystem, particularly among women  and individuals from underrepresented  communities. a larger and more diverse  developer community helps create more new  ideas and businesses, and it gives more people  access to employment and opportunities for  economic mobility. some participants are also  undertaking practical projects in collaboration  with ngos to help use technology to solve  challenges related to their missions, which  amplifies impact even further. we offer two distinct training programs as part  of the apple developer academy:  )  -day  foundations courses that cover specific topic  areas, including an introductory course for  those considering app development as a career  path, and  ) a more intensive academy program  of at least   to   months that dives deeper  into coding and professional skills. in addition  to partnering with institutions, the academy  works closely with employers to provide direct  pathways to career opportunities. participants  also have access to a strong alumni network   as they move forward in their careers. as of april  , we have   foundation  programs and   academy programs across  the globe working in close collaborations with  institutions that provide content and experience  opportunities. the programs are based in seven  countries with over   participants in total   in calendar year   — and more than    ,  since the inception of the apple  developer academy in  .  on

their app-driven  businesses as they build the next generation  of cutting-edge apps, and to form a global  alumni network that encourages the pipeline  and longevity of underrepresented founders  and developers in technology. the program  includes cohorts for female, black, and  hispanic/latinx founders and developers from  underrepresented communities. during these app-focused technology labs,  participants receive one-on-one code-level  guidance on their apps from apple experts  and engineers, as well as support, inspiration,  and insights from top apple leaders. the core  programming is based on developer labs at  wwdc, where participants work on improving a  specific app in bespoke, one-on-one sessions  with apple engineers and experts. the program  also includes community sessions, networking,  and opportunities for ongoing support. after  the lab concludes, participants become part  of a growing community of other exceptional  alumni who can help them build their business.  apple entrepreneur camp alumni have gone  on to secure major funding rounds, garner  numerous awards and accolades, and  significantly expand both their teams and app  users worldwide. alumni apps are featured on  the entrepreneur camp  website .there have been   entrepreneur camp  cohorts since our first class of female founders  and developers in  . since the launch of  reji, we expanded to

friendship. the program equipped the authors with apple  technology, including ipad pro, apple pencil, and magic keyboard, so they could  continue to share their stories and explore new media for creative expression in  illustration and audio.  for many of the students, who had neither imagined they’d write books nor  worked in these apps prior to the program, the sessions sparked inspiration for  future endeavors and opened doors to new modes of storytelling. through an  apple grant, shout mouse press was also able to further support the students’  post-program journey with scholarship funding for authors applying for college  and post-secondary programs. the books these students authored can be  enjoyed and downloaded for free on apple books. joy ugwu (pictured), a participant of

engages with stakeholders as part of   our commitment to advance meaningful change  and find novel solutions to pressing challenges.  every day, at all levels of the business, we  interact with a variety of stakeholders to  listen and learn from others’ perspective and  experiences, share our progress, and promote  best practices. stakeholders provide valuable  expertise as we develop our programs, and by  collaborating with other stakeholders, we can  drive more impact on the issues we care about  than any one of us could make on our own. throughout the year, we proactively engage  with a wide range of stakeholders and rights  holders, including: our people we believe that open and honest communication  among team members, managers, and  leadership fosters an open, collaborative work  environment where everyone can participate,  develop, and thrive. our peoples’ voices and  ideas drive innovation in everything we do  — from informing diversity initiatives to the  inclusive benefits that support employees of  all backgrounds through every life stage. in  addition to managers listening to their teams,  we conduct surveys to better understand team  member views across key topics, and we provide  channels for employees to share concerns  with leadership. read more in our people on  page   . suppliers whether through social dialogue and  formal employee representation, workplace  satisfaction surveys, anonymous hotlines,  focus groups, or interviews during annual  assessments, the feedback we receive directly  from supplier employees helps us ensure  that labor and human rights are respected  throughout our global supply chain. we also  use this feedback to address emerging risks,  improve rights training for supplier employees  and management, and continually strengthen  our supplier code of conduct and supplier  responsibility standards. customers we’re motivated by creating the best user  experience through our products and in every  interaction with our customers. to help ensure  quality, we continually monitor customer  feedback, assess key drivers, and leverage  analytics to improve the customer experience.  customer feedback is shared with team  members as well as leaders, so that everyone  understands their impact and is focused on  making the customer experience the best   it can possibly be. see more on page   . ngos, multi-stakeholder

emissions from r&d processes.  . beginning in fy , we’re accounting for scope   emissions from the  purchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.  . in fiscal year  , we started calculating scope   emissions not listed in  this table. in fiscal year  , these include electricity transmission and  distribution losses amounted to about  ,  metric tons co  e and life  cycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about   ,  metric tons co  e. we have not accounted for emissions resulting  from employees working from home, because we anticipated these  emissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving  our methodology.   . we regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability  standards. so in fiscal year  , we changed how we calculate emissions  from business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air  travel. as a result of this change, our scope   transportation emissions  increased by   percent between   and  . without the methodology  change, these emissions would have increased by   percent, which reflects  the growth in our business.  . beginning in fiscal year  , we updated our methodology to reflect the  impact of covid-  on employee commute.  . we retired  ,  metric tons of carbon credits from the chyulu hills project  in kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal  year  . this project is certified to the vcs and ccb standards.  . because we’re committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine  our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. for example,  we recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our  products are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid  emission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. the   net result was an increase in our   carbon footprint. when using the  same level of data granularity and model as  , our product use carbon  emissions in   would have been about  .  percent lower.  . for fiscal year  , we retired credits from the chyulu hills project in kenya,  and purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total  of  ,  metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. the first  project, a redd+ coastal conservation project in guatemala, protects and  conserves forests from deforestation and degradation. the second project   aims to establish forests on about  ,  hectares of barren land that is not  otherwise in use across seven counties in the guizhou province of china.  both projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for  projects in the restore fund, including vcs and ccbs. these projects are all  certified to the vcs and ccb standards.  . due to rounding, our gross and net carbon footprints do not always the sum  of the subtotals disclosed above.   notes: for data on previous years, please reference past environmental

 introduction sustainability people appendix opening  letter from kara hurst reflecting on the last year, i’m proud of the work our teams  around the world have accomplished and i’m excited about what’s ahead. we have taken important steps forward in our social, community, and environmental work, while always expanding our vision for the future. at the center of it all is our customer obsession. sustainability is an important issue for our customers around the world, and we are continually investing, inventing, and improving to make every customer interaction more sustainable than the last. this isn’t a distant vision for the future—this work is well underway now. take our e-commerce business. from the moment a customer clicks “buy now” to when their package arrives on their doorstep, we have teams of scientists and engineers working to make that process more sustainable, all without compromising on speed, safety, or convenience. we are deploying new building technologies, such as low-carbon concrete, to make our facilities more sustainable—as seen in the launch of our second headquarters buildings, which set a new standard for sustainable design. we are investing in renewable energy around the world, and we are the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world for the third year in a row. our teams are analyzing routes and distances to build a logistics system that gets packages to customers faster, with fewer emissions. and we are transitioning our fleet to roll out  ,  rivian electric delivery vehicles by  , with thousands on the road now.  and that’s just a small part of our story. while our most visible sustainability work may be in how we deliver orders to customers’ doorsteps, we are more than an e-commerce company. amazon is an entertainment studio, cloud provider, grocer, and more—and we are making sustainability a priority across all of our businesses. for example, sustainability might not be top of mind when you tune in to watch your favorite amazon original series, but it is for us. we are reducing the use of fossil fuels from our production studios, deploying battery-electric generators, using solar-powered cast trailers, and scaling the use of electric vehicles on our sets. we are doing all of this in the background while delivering exciting new shows for our customers. cloud computing also plays a role in reducing our customers’ environmental impact. with amazon web services (aws), customers no longer run their own data centers, which often operate at low utilization rates, leading to a lot of wasted energy. instead, customers can take advantage of the advanced engineering of aws data centers that utilize some of the most highly reliable, secure, energy-efficient hardware in the world. aws can lower customers’ workload carbon footprints by nearly  % versus on-premises computing workload, and we expect that number to increase once aws is fully powered by renewable energy. in the communities where we operate, we are also doing our part to help solve rapidly growing challenges facing the world today. take water scarcity as an example. amid unprecedented droughts around the world, we committed that by  , aws data centers will return more water to communities than they use in their direct operations.  no matter the industry, from entertainment to grocery to cloud computing, we are determined to show the world that if we can do this, others can too. in many cases, our work sends important demand signals to the market, which helps drive more renewable energy, more-sustainable building materials, and other innovations that help businesses and organizations around the world reduce their own impact on the environment.  scaling our positive impact is underpinned by the climate pledge—a commitment to be net-zero carbon by  —which we co-founded in  . the pledge invites every sector that touches our business (and those that don’t) to make their own ambitious climate commitments. we are creating a community that inspires each other to do more, and to out-innovate even ourselves as we know we can’t do this alone. more than   companies across   countries signed the pledge by the end of  , and we are determined to keep bringing on new partners to help combat climate change. we are also committed to supporting third parties in their own decarbonization efforts. amazon has one of the largest value chains in the world. as we know the first step in reducing emissions is to understand them, we will continue to work directly with our suppliers, and, starting next year, will update our supply chain standards to require regular reporting and emissions goal setting. we’ll also use our scale, investment, and innovation to date to provide our suppliers with products and tools that will help them reach their goals—whether those are transitioning to renewable energy or increasing access to sustainable materials.  we recognize that sustainability does not have an expiration date, and there will always be more to do. but today, we are taking on some of the hardest problems in the world to solve, with a long-term view, which involves no shortcuts or quick fixes. we remain confident in our approach. you might not see all of the large-scale changes that we are making reflected imminently; our company thinks in the long term. we are working tirelessly to deliver on our sustainability commitments with the impact and scale our customers have come to expect from us, while bringing entire industries along with us and transforming how we work on planet earth.  when we look back at this moment in time, my hope is this: that our teams are immensely proud of the ambitious challenge we took on and the solutions we implemented, and that we have continued to build on our progress to keep thinking even bigger and moving even faster. that our customers see that we remained obsessed with tackling some of the world’s biggest sustainability challenges on their behalf. and that we were willing to make the big bets necessary—even if we wouldn’t see results for years to come—to ensure the next great climate solutions can scale fast to help set our planet back on the right track, and that all future generations can live in healthy, thriving communities. with gratitude,  kara hurst vice president, worldwide

expect from amazon. these are incredibly hard challenges. many of the solutions  r equired to achieve global decarbonization don’t exist yet.  and the challenges are also made more complex by the fact that—thanks to strong customer demand—we are a business that continues to grow. meeting the needs of our customers while simultaneously reducing our impact will take time, along with invention and collaboration from all areas of our company. teams across every part of amazon have a decarbonization strategy as part of their long-term organizational plan. we hold ourselves accountable through goal setting and regular reporting. we are investing in breakthrough technology, including promising early-stage decarbonization technology that we back through our $   billion climate pledge  fund. we cannot do this alone. we need governments around the w orld to work together with us as we engage in climate policy  to drive decarbonization at scale. we also need the support  of our suppliers and other businesses, which is why we are building a cross-sector community of companies, organizations, individuals, and partners through the climate pledge. in  , we were joined by   new

energy. in fact, in  , we announced that we grew our renewable energy capacity by   gigawatts, which was a record for the most announced by a company in a single year and made us the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for the third year in a row.  our carbon intensity decreased by  % from   to  ,  an d by  % since  . over the last four years, our business  has consistently become less carbon intensive, which further shows we are decoupling emissions growth from our growth as a business. carbon intensity measures grams of carbon dioxide equivalent ( co  e) per dollar of gross merchandise sales (gms).  decarbonizing delivery and logistics  unlike many other companies in the worlds of tech and retail, we have a large logistics network. direct emissions, such as   the fuel used by our delivery fleet, are counted in scope   emissions and make up just under one-fifth of our total emissions. in  , scope   emissions grew by  % year-over-year. this was due to business growth, increased transportation via amazon logistics rather than third parties, and an improvement in the way we calculate emissions, which follows the latest approaches to science-based corporate accounting of emissions. we are making great progress in reducing transportation  em issions where opportunities exist, such as by investing in  electric delivery vehicles. in  , we had more than  ,  of these vehicles in our global fleet, and delivered more than     million packages in the u.s. and europe to customers’  doorsteps with them. we have installed thousands of charging points across our facilities in north america and europe. we deployed e-cargo bikes, scooters, and on-foot deliveries from micromobility hubs, including in manhattan in new york city, and in   cities across europe, from london and paris to marseille and  munich.  we make further reductions by using algorithms to devise the  most efficient routes and locating fulfillment centers and  delivery stations closer to our customers. our packaging team devises smaller and lighter packing options, which take up less space to transport and therefore result in fewer emissions. in fact, since  , we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging per shipment by  % on average and avoided more than   million tons of packaging material. to drive down emissions from long-haul trucking, we launched ou r first electric heavy goods vehicles (ehgvs) in the united  kingdom (uk) and germany. the trucks can weigh up to   metric tons, so the transition relies on the rollout of large-scale charging infrastructure, which also often requires the overhaul of local electricity grids. we are teaming up with ehgv manufacturers to advocate for the changes  required. we are not just using more evs. we already have more than

harder to decarbonize are airfreight and cargo shipping. this is because the net-zero technologies required to move large volumes of goods over long distances by sea and air do not yet exist at scale, nor do the supporting infrastructure or accounting frameworks. yet we are determined to accelerate progress. we are active partners in industrywide coalitions,  including cargo owners for zero emission vessels (cozev),  which we helped launch, and the sustainable aviation buyers alliance (saba), which is focused on increasing investment in sustainable aviation fuel (saf). introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix we are optimistic that emissions will substantially fall across  the transportation and logistics sectors over the next decade. electric vehicle production is becoming mainstream. already, policymakers are encouraging the infrastructure transformation needed to support a new generation of net-zero transportation through measures like the bipartisan infrastructure law and inflation reduction act in the u.s., and the european commission’s green deal industrial plan, which incentivize investment in clean energy. as these changes take effect, they will translate into lower emissions for all companies that, like amazon, transport large numbers of items over thousands of miles. investing in renewables we are proud that our investments in renewable energy, used to power our operations, have resulted in a  % drop in carbon emissions from purchased electricity (scope  ). this now accounts for less than  % of our total reported carbon footprint. in  ,  % of electricity consumed by amazon was attributable to renewable energy sources, and we remain on a path to reach  % by  . electricity powers our data centers, fulfillment centers, physical  s tores, and corporate offices, as well as the evs that charge  at our delivery stations. as a first step, we focus on energy efficiency throughout our operations. we then purchase electricity from renewable energy projects, through on-site solar installations and utility-scale, off-site solar and wind projects. we grew our total number of renewable projects to   in   countries, with a capacity of more than   gw. that’s enough capacity to power the equivalent of  .   million u.s.  homes every  year. key to making renewable energy more impactful is to find ways of s toring it for when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t  shining. we continue to invest in renewable energy projects that are paired with energy storage. additionally, in  , the climate pledge fund invested in electric hydrogen and sunfire, two promising u.s.- and europe-based developers of electrolyzers, which convert water into green hydrogen—an energy source that can be stored for future use. it’s another example of the investment in innovation that amazon is known  for. reducing our scope   emissions activities that take place beyond our direct operations are reflected in our scope   emissions. in  , scope   emissions went down by  . %, despite our year-over-year growth.  we saw a decrease in scope   emissions from building  c onstruction, leased buildings and equipment, and third-party  transportation (as more goods were shipped by amazon’s own logistics providers versus third-party  providers). we know that to further drive down emissions, we must e nsure those in our supply chain make the operational changes  necessary to decarbonize their businesses. to that end, we will update our supply chain standards to require suppliers to share their carbon emissions data with us, including setting goals to reduce emissions as we work together to serve our customers. we will use our size and scale to benefit businesses that are committed to decarbonizing by providing products and tools to both track emissions and help decrease them. and we will continue to look for suppliers that help us achieve our decarbonization vision as we select partners for business  opportunities.  given our success as the world’s largest corporate purchaser of r enewable energy, we will seek to help select suppliers  transition to carbon-free electricity. our potential for impact across our supply chain is big because it spans building materials, transportation, technical equipment, products, and p ackaging, and we look forward to having further impact in  supply chain  decarbonization. to reduce indirect emissions, it’s important to be able to m easure them accurately. we support and fund industry  partnerships to gather more accurate data, including the embodied carbon in construction calculator (ec ), which helps measure embodied carbon in buildings, and the smart freight centre’s global logistics emissions council (glec) framework, a globally recognized methodology for measuring freight transportation  emissions. the road to   decarbonizing our business requires investment that will not always result in immediate outcomes. some of the work that we did in   to reduce emissions is not reflected in our e missions figures for  , and we may not see its impact for  years to  come. like other large corporates and many signatories to the pledge, w e do not have all the answers today, not least because in  many cases the answers do not yet exist or they do exist but are not yet available at scale. we are, however, steadfast in pursuing solutions and working collectively to find the answers and create the demand signals to bring new technologies to scale. we remain focused on reaching net-zero carbon by  , a focus we have maintained since we first announced the climate pledge in  . through innovation, collaboration, determination, and a promise to deliver the best for our customers, we will achieve our goal, and most importantly, contribute to a future on a healthier planet. turbines generate clean electricity at a utility-scale amazon wind farm.     amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions

gender equity  fund.  through the climate pledge fund, we invest in companies—like  electric aircraft innovator beta technologies—that are developing low-carbon solutions. in  , amazon became a founding member of the climate  resolute coalition, a multistakeholder organization focused on advancing women’s economic empowerment and climate solutions in global supply chains. we also work with various other organizations to enhance equitable opportunities for climate tech entrepreneurs, including greentown labs and elemental excelerator.      amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix amazon’s delivery and  logistics network we rely on a complex transportation network to get products  from manufacturers and sellers to customers around the globe. our logistics network spans every step of the journey—from global transportation to    delivery between delivery station and customer. to deliver packages as quickly and efficiently as possible, our logistics network uses different modes of transportation, including ships, planes, freight trains, trucks, vans, and bikes.as well as transporting products in a safe, timely, and efficient manner, we  are decarbonizing transportation across our  business  by:  • increasing fleet efficiency across inbound transportation, middle mi le, and last mile • scaling use of evs and alternative-fuel vehicles  • inc reasing use of low-carbon fuels • partner i ng on initiatives to decarbonize the wider  transport at ion industry  while emerging technologies in sustainable transportation will con t  inue to scale in the coming years, the most effective  way to reduce our transportation-related emissions is through improved fulfillment network efficiencies and supply chain optimization. fulfilling items inventoried as close to our custom e rs as possible reduces the distances packages travel  to reach customers, particularly in middle mile transportation, where long-haul trucking is a large emissions source. shorter routes also make our network more conducive to introducing evs and other lower-impact transportation modes in the long  term. in addition to closing the distance between fulfillment and custom e r, we are working to reduce emissions per shipped unit  by increasing the number of customer orders distributed per trip. for example, we use machine learning algorithms for each order to determine the best packaging solution to eliminate empty space in packages. computer vision and natural language processing guide our system to pinpoint the optimal packaging type for each item—from bag to box—depending on the leve l of protection needed. where possible, we use  lightweight packaging by prioritizing flexible paper bags and envelopes, which are up to  % lighter than similar-sized, rigid corrugate  boxes. we also look to increase the number of items per order, where relevant , encouraging customers to consolidate items into fewer  orders by choosing an “amazon day” for delivery to minimize the emissions associated with fulfilling their order. inbound transportation: the first transportation leg,  used for transporting shipments across international borders. manufacturer products are produced  and assembled. in bound cross dock warehouse operation consolidates loads without intermediate storage.  middle mile: the intermediate

linehaul post office deli very station packages are routed to customers through local post offices and delivery stations. fin al delivery customer packages are delivered to the customer’s door.     amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix inbound transportation inbound transportation teams aim to optimize the speed and  cost of cross-border transportation so it’s as simple, fast, and reliable as domestic transportation. amazon is increasing the use of ocean freight for transoceanic  transpor tation, and reducing airfreight when possible. as  an added benefit, ocean transportation has a lower carbon intensity than air transportation, and we continue to reduce the emissions related to ocean freight through the use of biofuels.   compared to road transportation, rail and sea transportation are more carbon-efficient. during  , in north america and europe, we increased our total rail load volume; we continue to grow it at an accelerated rate, which will help meet our net-zero-carbon goals. middle mile  middle mile transportation generally starts when packages  arrive at an amazon facility, such as a cross dock,  and includes  the journey between fulfillment centers, sort centers, and delivery stations. while some trips may be completed by air or train freight, middle mile transportation is usually completed by truck.  trucking is a challenging area to decarbonize, particularly  consideri ng long-haul distances and the requirements for  high-power ev charging infrastructure across transportation routes. there is currently no single solution that can be scaled for decarbonizing middle mile trucking. to help address this challenge, we are experimenting with lower-carbon options, such as trucks powered by renewable natural gas (rng),    battery-electric trucks, and hydrogen-powered  trucks.in  , we piloted a number of electric delivery trucks across north america and europe, with plans for more in  , and we are developing charging infrastructure. we also partner with manufacturers to test and validate new ev models before scaling the technology. notably, we have introduced   fully electric heavy goods vehicles (ehgvs) in germany, which will replace diesel-fueled road miles. five similar vehicles have been added to our uk fleet  . in  , we joined calstart,  and we are collaborating on the electric truck research and utilization center project to advance high-powered charging infrastructure along key freight corridors in california and beyond. low-carbon fuel technologies we are investing in interim ways to reduce the environmental impact of our middle mile truck fleet, including existing lower-emission options powered by rng. we are also investing in future solutions, like green steel   for manufacturing vehicles, as  well as renewably generated green hydrogen.  compressed natural gas (cng) trucks, especially when  powered b y rng created from waste stocks, provide an interim  emissions-reduction technology while ev and hydrogen fuel cell trucks continue to develop. we have procured millions of gallons of rng to power cng trucks in our north american fleet, reducing our reliance on fossil-fuel-based alternatives. we currently have  ,  cng trucks in north america and are partnering with other companies to launch fueling stations to support  them. in august, we also announced a procurement agreement with plug p ower. this partnership will supply amazon  with  ,  tons of green hydrogen per year—enough to power  ,  forklifts annually—for transportation and building operations, starting in   . last mile  last mile transportation refers to the final part of the journey, when products are transported from a post office or delivery station to the customer. traditionally, these trips have been made by gas-powered internal combustion engine vehicles. while these are still common across the industry, we are working to decarbonize our own last mile fleet by utilizing lower-emission options, including evs, electric cargo bikes (e-bikes), and on-foot deliveries. we are expanding our low-carbon electric delivery fleet with  thousan ds of evs. at the end of  , m ore than  ,  rivian  electric delivery vans were on the road in the u.s., and we aim to have  ,  on the road by  . throughout  , we had more than  ,  evs in our fleet and delivered   m illion  packages to customers via ev across the u.s. and europe. we also scaled ev adoption in indian operations, deploying over  ,  evs in our last mile delivery fleet, as well as   m iddle  mile evs, by the end of  .  in  , we announced plans to invest over €   billion  to double  our europ ean zero-emissions fleet for middle and last mile  deliveries over the next five years.  did you know?  amazon offers prime members fast delivery options, including same-day and one-day delivery. we also offer the amazon day delivery option, which gives prime members the ability to choose a designated day of the week to receive their orders. in  , amazon day saved   million boxes. mitigating emissions with micromobility solutions in europe, we have launched micromobility hubs in more than   cities to enable shorter deliveries on foot or by e-bike. in the uk specifically, we launched e-bikes in manchester and london. similar hubs have been installed across france and italy, with further micromobility solutions planned. in the u.s., we continue to improve grocery micromobility  deliver y operations in new york. our efforts to deliver grocery  orders on foot or via e-bike began in   and have since expanded to cover over  .   million orders (over  .   million  packages) in  . this was enabled, in part, by stocking inventory closer to customers. during  , we also introduced new, higher-payload e-bike trailers designed to carry heavier packages. these reduce operational costs by converting sites where deliveries are made on foot to use e-bikes and allowing more deliveries to be completed per bike route. we plan to deploy next-generation micromobility equipment in   . amazon ceo, andy jassy, with a new electric delivery vehicle at amazon’s  seattle headquarters.      amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix partnering for decarbonized  transportation  decarbonizing our transportation business will require cross- company partnerships, which is why we seek to participate in multistakeholder initiatives to shift the industry toward lower-carbon solutions. for our transportation decarbonization partnerships, we leverage two engagement platforms: the sustainable freight buyers alliance (sfba) and the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) international transport forum. in  , we continued to support the smart freight centre,  wi th a focus on identifying and building partnerships that  can accelerate transportation decarbonization. amazon is also playing an active role in several industry initiatives and government partnerships, including the cozev network, the first movers coalition, and the clean energy demand  initiative.  air  airfreight is one of the modes of transportation we use, and saf is one solution for reducing associated lifecycle emissions. however, saf represents less than  . % of global aviation fuel, because it is still cost prohibitive for most companies.   during  the   united nations climate change conference (cop ), saba announced a digital saf certificate registry that aims to increase transparency for emissions-reduction claims and accelerate saf deployment. as a founding member of saba, amazon played a key role in developing the registry, which will launch later this year.ocean to reduce our ocean-freight-related transportation emissions, ships used to transport goods must transition to using zero-emission fuels. in early  , we co-founded the zero emission maritime buyers alliance (zemba) together with the aspen institute, patagonia, and tchibo. in march  , inter ikea group also joined the alliance. through zemba, freight buyers will accelerate commercial deployment of zero-emission shipping, enable economies of scale, and minimize maritime emissions, helping to get zero-emission ships on the water by the mid- s. land heavy-duty truck freight is another key, yet emissions-intensive, component of most delivery networks, and one we are working to decarbonize through scaling the use of evs. in december  , we co-founded sfba, a group committed to decarbonizing freight operations. members are working to increase demand for medium- and heavy-duty battery evs and charging infrastructure, as well as align on models for fleet electrification. building construction  and operations we aspire to have the most sustainable real estate portfolio in  the world. today, our portfolio comprises thousands of facilities in   countries, including operations buildings (fulfillment centers, delivery stations, warehouses, and sort centers), corporate offices, data centers, and physical retail stores. we aim to reduce emissions across our portfolio through increased energy efficiency, expanding our use of renewable energy, and reducing embodied carbon in construction by using lower-emissions materials.  we use an enterprise building management system (ebms) to  ma nage facility energy use, seeking to use energy as efficiently  as possible to reduce associated emissions. by the end of  , our ebms was active in more than  ,  facilities globally. this standardized platform controls various building systems and has alarms to proactively alert site teams to equipment failures. in  , we plan to expand ebms implementation across our global facilities to help further reduce  emissions.   corporate offices throughout  , our global real estate and facilities team made progress in establishing foundational practices for building and maintaining sustainable buildings. guidelines were developed and shared with internal teams for integrating more-sustainable practices across leasing, design, construction, and operations. we also gathered crucial data to inform building-specific ca rbon-reduction roadmaps and   energy-reduction  projects. using this data, we plan to build a tool to enhance our understanding of current energy and carbon efficiencies and to establish energy performance  targets.  in response to the energy shortage in europe, we quickly im plemented energy-reduction measures that we plan to scale  globally to enhance efficiency across our corporate  buildings.  physical stores in addition to designing new sites with sustainability in mind, we upgraded existing stores with technologies that deliver greater efficiency and carbon emissions savings. physical stores include those for whole foods market, amazon fresh, and amazon go.  international living future institute certification  several of our amazon go stores are seeking zero carbon certification (zcc) with the international living future institute (ilfi). the certification requires locations to lower energy use, eliminate on-site gas combustion, and build using lower-carbon materials. in addition to demonstrating our commitment to the climate pledge, these certified sites serve as test beds for technologies that we can scale across our business.      amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix the thousands of panes of glass

efficiency  performance by  % from a   baseline, achieving the u.s. department of energy better buildings challenge goal two years ahead of schedule. these improvements were driven, in part, by investing in alternative refrigerants with lower global warming potential (gwp); installing energy-efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac) systems; implementing retrofit projects; and launching an energy-awareness program for st ore operations.  amazon fresh stores in the u.s. and eu also made strides on energy ef f  iciency throughout  , using efficient lighting as  standard in all buildings and expanding the use of doors on in-store refrigerated  cases. natural refrigeration  several retail locations are piloting natural refrigerants with near-zero gwp, as well as low-gwp refrigeration technologies.    as of the end of  ,   whole foods market stores had instal led low-gwp refrigeration systems. an additional    stores have been retrofitted to use next-generation solstice n  refrigerant, which has a gwp approximately  % lower than legacy hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants. all uk amazon fresh stores operate with either natural or low-gwp  systems. reducing natural gas use  we are introducing technologies to electrify systems that traditionally run on natural gas, including kitchen equipment, water heaters, and hvac systems. amazon fresh stores in the uk have moved to fully electric systems, while in the u.s., we are piloting fully electric kitchens in several locations. amazon go has expanded electric hvac equipment in washington state and california.  addressing hard-to-abate carbon emissions we look to address our largest remaining source of buildings emissions—embodied carbon,   primarily in  the concrete and steel used in construction. we use the embodied carbon in construction calculator (ec ) tool to track embodied carbon in our building projects. in  , we tracked embodied carbon from more than   building projects through ec .  throughout  , we partnered with various  organizations to improve embodied carbon reporting. t ogether with introba, we developed a methodology  for understanding and quantifying embodied carbon in material handling and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing equipment. additionally, we collaborated with the chart ered institution of building services engineers  to develop guidance to measure embodied carbon in technologies for the logistics sector. we launched a program to find and validate  transformational technologies as lower-cost alternatives to carbon cr edits  in the most difficult-to-abate areas  of our building portfolio. we have also introduced a technical review committee to assess and recommend promising technologies to improve resource planning.  the

continue delivering optimal service while building  a more sustainable business, aws is designing data centers—including our servers and hardware—for efficiency, resiliency, and a lower carbon footprint.  energy efficiency research shows that in north america, aws can lower customers’ workload carbon footprints by nearly  % compared to on-premises computing workloads, and up to  % once aws is powered with  % renewable energy—a target we are on a path to meet by  .   when servers are in use, they produce heat. if they produce too much heat, it can impact their performance and lifespan. air conditioning systems can be energy-inefficient, which is why we look to maximize use of natural air flow to lower server temperatures and energy use requirements. when we design aws data centers, particularly our data halls, we use models that examine how air moves through spaces. we then create a digital representation of this movement to determine physical properties such as temperature, pressure, and velocity at any location throughout the data hall. this allows us to fully understand how data centers will perform before they’re even built, enabling optimization for higher system reliability and energy efficiency. learn more about how we optimize data center cooling syst ems   .one of the most visible ways we are innovating for power ef ficiency is our investment in purpose-built aws machine  learning chips. our third-generation arm-based chip, aws graviton , is more energy-efficient, as graviton -based elastic compute cloud instances use up to  % less energy for the same performance than comparable amazon ec  instances. in  , we launched aws trainium, a high-performance machine learning chip designed to reduce the time and cost of training generative ai models—cutting training time for some mo dels from months to hours. this, in turn, means building  new models requires less money and power, with potential cost savings of up to  % and energy-consumption reductions of up to  %, versus comparable instances. inferentia is our most power-efficient machine learning inference chip. our inferentia machine learning chip is up to  % m ore

climate solutions carbonpeople appendix embodied carbon aws strives to reduce embodied carbon associated with  concrete and steel, the two most carbon-intensive materials used to build our data centers. this includes carbon emitted during extraction, manufacturing, and transportation of materials to data center construction sites.  we are working with various suppliers on lower-carbon  conc rete options. for example, in northern virginia, aws  worked with building material provider holcim to procure ecopact concrete for several data centers. the concrete mix reduces carbon emissions by nearly  % compared to standard concrete. aws worked with american rock products (arp), a crh company, to develop a more sustainable concrete mix for data centers across northeastern oregon. arp completed environmental product declarations, which summarize environmental impacts across the concrete’s lifecycle, for all products at their plants. globally in  , we completed the construction of   data centers using lower-carbon concrete and   data centers using lower-carbon steel. we expect these numbers to grow considerably in  . we are also focused on reducing embodied emissions as sociated with the manufacturing of aws hardware, including  silicon-based devices like processors and solid-state drives. as these emissions are primarily from material extraction and product manufacturing, the path to decarbonizing chip production involves all parts of the lifecycle. to address this, we are working with suppliers to improve their energy efficiency and power their operations with more renewable  energy.keeping technologies in use longer we are reducing emissions related to server use and networking equipment by increasing server lifespan. this includes refining software to run more efficiently, subsequently lowering stress on hardware and extending its useful life. in  , we extended aws server life from four years to five and networking equipment life from five years to six. to support these efforts, aws has a robust maintenance and repair program designed to increase component reuse and further reduce carbon emissions and waste across our supply chain. to help prevent our equipment from ending up  in landfills and avoid associat ed emissions, we are  investing in responsible end-of-life management systems. aws uses reverse logistics hubs to evaluate and reuse electronic equipment in our global data center fleet. these hubs help us consolidate, assess, and recirculate functional equipment back into our inventory. when we no longer have use for equipment, we remove all customer data and sell the equipment on the secondary market for reuse or work with a network of experienced vendors to recycle parts. to extend the useful life of data center hardware, aws sends all functional,  sanitized, retired server racks and components to its reverse logistics hubs.carbon neutralization the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) has  made clear that significant carbon emissions from several sectors of the economy will not be fully abated by  .   even  with aggressive decarbonization efforts, many companies will need to neutralize some ghg emissions that cannot be eliminated to achieve net-zero  carbon. carbon neutralization represents an opportunity for us to he lp reduce emissions and stabilize our changing climate.  we are focused on three global transformations: halting tropical rainforest loss, restoring degraded land, and scaling technologies that capture carbon  emissions.  learn more about how, in  , amazon analyzed and invest ed in various promising carbon-removal technologies  through the climate pledge fund   . protecting the world’s  tropical rainforests tropical deforestation contributes approximately one-fifth  of global emissions.  ending deforestation will require more  effective government policy, local stakeholder collaboration, and new pathways for sustainable economic development in tropical forest  regions.  in  , amazon helped create the lowering emissions by a ccelerating forest finance (leaf) coalition, which has  mobilized over $   billion  in corporate and government finance  to protect tropical rainforests around the world. in  , during cop , four brazilian states signed letters of intent to participate in the coalition, bringing participating tropical

storage to collect and save clean energy for use when renewable energy sources are unavailable—such as at night or during periods of high demand—and to provide grid stability.  during  , we launched solar projects paired with battery storage capabilities in arizona and california. together, the projects deliver   m w of energy, alongside   m w of  battery storage. across our portfolio, we now hold   m w of  storage capacity. we are looking to increasingly pair renewable generators with storage to provide near  /  carbon-free electricity on grids with significant solar.  while storage solutions have the potential to meet energy  requirements when supply isn’t readily available, current constraints, such as high costs, mean we continue to pilot storage on a small scale. supporting a just clean energy transition as the world’s largest corporate renewable energy purchaser, we have a unique role to play in supporting a just, equitable, and sustainable clean energy transition. in may  , amazon became a founding member of beyond the megawatt—an initiative by the clean energy buyers institute (cebi) to maximize the environmental and social benefits of the clean energy transition.  as a member, we support beyond the megawatt’s efforts  to address resilience, social equity, and environmental protection issues by scaling impact-oriented clean-energy procurement strategies. the development of industrywide procurement standards to promote social impact and human rights within clean energy buying is critical to this partnership. these standards are expected in  . a global clean energy transition will also require increased supplies of minerals that power more-sustainable technologies. this rise in demand has the potential to benefit millions through inclusive economic

the emissions data ecosystem • enhance emissions accounting governancewith the introduction of more renewable energy  options into electrical grids globally, the variability of generation mixes increases, resulting in carbon emissions that vary substantially based on time and location. with this in mind, it’s more important than ever that decision-makers opt for renewable electricity options that maximize emissions reductions. making the right electricity choices relies on accurately understanding the most significant decarbonization opportunities. learn more about the  emissions first principles  .advocating for renewable  energy solutions amazon seeks to accelerate global adoption of cleaner energy  options through public policy  engagement. in the u.s., the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) is driving efforts to modernize the electricity grid. this work is important because grid-enhancing technologies (gets) can bring renewables to more people by unlocking capacity and improving efficiency. gets also complement the advancement of new transmission infrastructure. combined, this means faster, more cost-effective deployment of clean energy. we ha v e publicly stated our support of ferc’s proposal to  require incorporation of corporate energy commitments into long-term planning for bringing new renewable resources onto the grid. we also support policy development for accelerating how new renewables are connected to the grid, encouraging ferc to update the process for integrating wind, solar, and storage projects into the national energy  mix.  we seek to advance national renewable energy goals where we operate. for example, in indonesia, we plan to buy electricity from third-party solar parks being installed in bali and java and connected to the java-madura-bali grid. not only will this help renewably power our local operations, it will also support indonesia’s goal to increase the use of renewables. looking forward we will continue exploring ways to renewably power our operations, introducing new wind, solar, and storage projects to reduce our reliance on carbon-based energy sources. throughout  , we will identify new technologies that accelerate renewable energy deployment and, ultimately, help us achieve our net-zero carbon emissions goal. we will also engage additional device component suppliers to establish renewable-energy implementation  plans.     amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability peo ple appendi x reducing pac kaging and waste packaging packaging packaging is one of the

circular economy for materials and products, not only can we keep valuable resources in use for longer, but we can also reduce related impac t s such as carbon emissions and environmental  pollution.  we are working to eliminate waste and increase recycling and reuse a cross our business. we are also optimizing product  design and providing our customers with opportunities to repair, resell, recycle, and repurpose products and materials.  amazon’s approach for materials use this waste hierarchy is a framework that helps guide our approach to  managing and avoiding waste. it represents the most preferred option at the top to the least preferred at the bottom. we are focused on reducing our impact by pursuing opportunities that are more preferred before moving down the hierarchy.  avoidwe improve product and packaging design, inventory management, materials sourcing, and resource use to avoid or eliminate waste generation from the start.  reducewe pur sue avenues such as increased product durability and  resal e to reduce waste. reuse wher e possible, we repair, repurpose, and donate usable items. recyclewe recycle and compost to recover raw materials where possible,  inclu d ing food  waste. incineration with  energy recoverywhere avoidance, reduction, reuse, or recycling aren’t possible, we  target energy recovery. landfill and  incineration without energy recoverythis is a last resort for materials and products that currently cannot be diverted  to better recovery pathways. for example, some hazardous products and materials must be disposed of in this manner for health and safety reasons. avoiding and  managing waste waste is generated in both our direct operations, including  some subsidiaries, and in our supply chain. we classify it by two categories: internal (direct) or external (indirect). direct waste is produced inside amazon’s organizational boundaries; indirect waste is generated by third parties (e.g., suppliers, customers). the primary materials streams for amazon’s footprint include:  • operations:  this covers any waste from amazon’s internal  operation s and falls into two categories: noninventory and  inventory  (product).  – noninventory materials streams include nonproduct  materia l (i.e., goods not intended to generate revenue)  that is discarded. this includes used office furniture, corrugate, shrink wrap, break room waste, and damaged storage  equipment. – inventory materials streams include heavily damaged and unsold  products, customer returns that cannot be repaired,  food that is no longer safe for consumption, unused nonfood inventory, and goods that cannot be donated, sold via wholesalers, or sold on amazon warehouse.     à food waste:  foo d-related waste is generated in our  amazon  kitchen manufacturing facilities, physical  grocery retail stores, and fulfillment  centers.  • customer:  waste generated at the customer product-use  phase o r in the form of product and delivery  packaging   ,  including end-of-life  impa cts. • construction:  waste generated from construction  activ ities related to building our facilities. consists mainly of  comingled construction and demolition waste like metals, masonry, asphalt, and  drywall. • supply chain:  in addition to our direct footprint, we are  focus ed on reducing supply chain waste, which is waste  generated by third-party suppliers who manufacture products for, and provide goods and services to, amazon.    amazon sustainability report  introduction sustainability reducing packaging and waste  waste and circularitypeople appendix our progress operational waste operational waste  is what we can most directly control and  impact. we manage operational waste generated across our  business, including grocery, retail, e-commerce, office buildings, and data  centers.  noninventory materials management noninventory waste is generated from materials used to run our businesses. corrugate represents one of our largest noninventory materials streams and we work closely with third-party recycling vendors to remove excess corrugate for off-site recycling. we are also scaling single-stream recycling, composting, and plastic film recycling across our operations. we strive to avoid electronic waste generation and, when this is not possible, focus on reuse and recycling. we pursue solutions and industry partnerships to advance  more beneficial end-of-life path ways for materials. we also  continually improve our data architecture to enhance waste tracking and management. additionally, in  , we launched a centralized waste-collection initiative across select corporate buildings in the u.s. to replace desk-side bins with communal alternatives, which is expected to increase waste diversion by  %.  aws waste reduction through  reverse logistics amazon web services (aws) is embracing circular economy  principles for our server racks by designing reusable and lower-carbon rack systems, keeping equipment operating efficiently, and recovering value from securely decommissioned equipment through reuse, repair, and recycling. this allows us to keep resources at their highe st value for as long as  possible—reducing waste generation from our global operations, and decreasing the use of raw materials and carbon emissions across our supply chain. we are focused on three  priorities:  • design:  at aws, server rack circularity and sustainability begin  with design. we focus on eliminat ing excess materials such  as steel or plastic, increasing recycled and bio-based content, and planning for repair, reuse, and recycling from the start. • operate:  using our equipment for as long as operationally  efficient reduces the carbon fo otprint associated with using  hardware. in  , we extended aws server life from four years to five and that of networking equipment from five years to six. in addition, aws has a robust maintenance and repair program designed to increase component reuse and further reduce carbon emissions and waste across our supply  chain. • recover: when it is time for server racks to be  decommissioned, sanitized eq uipment is routed to our  reverse logistics hubs in the u.s. and ireland. these hubs test, repair, and recirculate non-media-storage equipment back to data centers or to be sold for reuse by third parties. we do this on a global scale, funneling all retired rack systems through our dedicated reverse logistics network. centralizing the decommissioning process also allows aws to optimize component reuse across our data centers, taking decommissioned equipment from one facility and redeploying it to serve demand elsewhere. inventory management amazon inventory management primarily involves items returned by customers, damaged in handling, or that are overstock. items that fit these descriptions are considered for resale, reuse, repair, or donation. we maximize product recovery through discount cha nnels, such as outlet, amazon  warehouse, and selling to  wholesalers. we take a circular approach to equipment, designing for reusability and operational efficiency, and recovering value through reuse, repair, and recycling.   customer returns avoidance: we want to help customers keep what they bought for as long as possible with product lifecycle support (pls) options that let people address post-purchase product issues. we currently offer three free post-purchase care options: original equipment manufacturer (oem) support and oem repair, where customers can go straight to the manufacturer for support; self service, which helps customers address issues themselves; and parts replacement, where customers can request available components to replace damaged or missing parts, free of charge. in  , pls

significantly across geographies. we are investing in data insights with the aim of designing a water program that can be tailored to unique geographic and business unit needs.  for example, aws has a goal to be water positive by   thr ough increasing water availability at and around operational  sites. we will achieve this by improving efficiency, using more-sustainable sources such as recycled water, returning water for community reuse, and supporting replenishment  projects. amazon’s water usage our global water use includes water used both in direct operations and in our wider supply chain. water is used in various ways across our facilities. for example: • data centers:  primarily use water in server-cooling  processes. • operations: use water in break rooms, kitchens, bathrooms,  and l andscape irrigation, particularly fulfillment centers, sort  centers, and delivery  stations. • physical stores (whole foods market and amazon fresh):   pri marily use water to clean and defrost foods. • offices:  mainly use water in office kitchens, bathrooms, and  landscape irrigation. beyond our operations, water is used to grow, process, and  man ufacture amazon products and

like recycled water and rainwater harvesting. as of  ,   data centers use recycled wastewater in cooling systems—  in virginia, two in california, and two in singapore. in brazil, two data centers collect rainwater to supply a portion of cooling water needs.  in several regions, we partner with community stakeholders  to ex pand recycled water infrastructure. doing so helps build  local resilience against increasing climate change-related water issues such as drought. in  , we worked with local government and water utilities in loudoun county, virginia, to expand the infrastructure network that delivers recycled water to the community. we are working with several other municipalities to scale similar  infrastructure. reusing cooling water  water discharged from data centers is safe for many uses, and we seek ways to return it to the communities in which we operate. to confirm water quality is maintained, we closely monitor it throughout our systems.  investing in water replenishment we are focused on restoring watersheds and increasing access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services in water-stressed communities. in  , aws completed projects with water.org   and wateraid to provide clean water and sanitation to over     ,  people across india and indonesia.  amazon is also partnering with water.org to launch the water   & cli mate fund   . the initiative will enable climate-resilient   water and sanitation solutions that create lasting access to safe  water sources for   m illion people across asia, africa, and   latin america. the fund will support

positive by  .we achieved this wni score, in part, by designing buildings  with rainwater-harvesting systems. additionally, these facilities recycle greywater—water from domestic streams such as sinks, cafeterias, and washrooms—for irrigation and flushing water for toilets. more-efficient fixtures such as waterless urinals and water restrainers for high-flow fixtures contribute to a reduction in washroom consumption. in all future sites in india, we plan to include rainwater-harvesting pits and meters, water-recycling systems, and efficient fixtures. we aim to improve data accuracy and will begin implementing a water use index, which tracks water consumption in relation to building footprint. in the united kingdom (uk), we are piloting a rainwater- harv esting system in wales, while installation of low-flow  fixtures is underway across new and existing fulfillment sites. in  , uk operational facilities implemented an active water leak detection program to proactively identify and address issues. planning is underway to scale this pilot globally.   physical stores by the end of  ,   whole foods market stores installed a new defrosting system that recycles meltwater instead of allowing it to run down the drain. this new system can reduce up to  . % of water use associated with defrosting. in  , we are assessing the potential to scale this technology to other whole foods market stores.  corporate offices in global corporate offices, we are increasing water recycling and low-flow fixtures. amazon set new standards for construction design in the u.s. to reduce indoor water use by  % versus a leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) baseline. we are scaling these standards globally. in  , the first phase of amazon’s second headquarters in arli ngton, virginia, was under construction. water-efficient  features for the two office towers, known as met park, include low-flow fixtures, domestic hot water heat pump heat recovery, rainwater and greywater capture and reuse systems, and groundwater heat-exchange  systems.  the recycling systems in met park alone are designed to save over   .  mi llion gallons of water annually, while groundwater  heat exchange will reduce annual cooling tower water usage by  ,  gallons. additionally, landscape areas are irrigated with  % reclaimed and treated greywater. altogether, met park is designed to reduce indoor water consumption by  % (compared to a leed v  baseline), reduce cooling tower water con sumption by  %, and eliminate potable water use for  irrigation. all in, met park is projected to use half as much water as similar-sized  buildings.  looking forward throughout  , we made progress across regions and businesses to improve wue. to build on this, we have launched a companywide water dashboard for greater oversight of site-by-site usage. in  , we will focus on data maturity and use insights to drive continual improvements.  the terrace gardens at our headquarters in arlington,

amazon products to support responsible supply  chains and contribute to growing circular economies. from groceries and cleaning supplies to fashion and devices, we carefully consider the materials and lifecycle impacts across our product categories.  in  , we developed a responsible sourcing roadmap  infor med by findings from our first comprehensive commodity  risk assessment for amazon devices and amazon private brands products. the roadmap focuses on key materials, including cotton, wood, pulp, paper, cobalt, and copper, and guides businesses in achieving greater visibility and positive impacts across our supply chains.  in december of  , amazon private brands and whole foods  mark et publicly committed to limit deforestation risks in food,  grocery, and consumable private brands products containing palm oil, soy, paper products, beef, cocoa, coffee, and tea. additionally, we successfully achieved previously published apparel goals on man-made cellulosic fibers and cotton. to ensure better standards for cotton more widely, we continue to sponsor and participate in the responsible sourcing network’s due diligence initiative, yess (yarn ethically & sustainably sourced), to identify and address forced labor in cotton production. in  , yess released its first standard for fabric mills and an updated standard for spinning mills, enhancing efforts to improve cotton supply chain due diligence. beyond responsible commodity sourcing, amazon private brand s is making progress toward measuring environmental  impacts in our supply chain and promoting safer chemistry. as part of the sustainable apparel coalition, we encourage suppliers to evaluate their practices using the higg facility environmental module (fem), a self-assessment which evaluates performance and prioritizes opportunities for improvement across seven impact areas: air emissions, carbon emissions, chemicals management, environmental management systems, waste, wastewater, and water.  in  , we joined the copper mark, which oversees the world’s only c omprehensive social and environmental assurance  program for the copper industry. we also participate in the responsible minerals initiative’s working groups devoted to smelter engagement and, in  , became governance committee members of the public-private alliance for responsible minerals trade.  additionally, in  , we supplemented our

that commitment by   to provide prepaid education and technical skills training to help  ,  hourly employees move into higher-paying roles. to achieve this goal, we maintain   global upskilling programs with various eligibility requirements. through these, we offer prepaid education, industry certifications, technical skills training, and apprenticeships to meet employees’ needs, no matter where they are on their professional journeys.  one of the most notable upskilling opportunities we offer is  career choice  , a program providing employees with skills  training, professional certificates, language learning, and college degrees. over  ,  employees have participated in career choice since it launched in  , receiving support from a global network of over   educational partners. in  , we extended career choice courses for eligible u.s. employees to include english as a second language (esl), high school completion programs, and prepaid college tuition. to prepare employees for future environmental sustainability roles, we introduced three new career choice pathways that lead to environmental technician, energy technician, and solar technician career opportunities. employees can also pursue industry certifications for in-demand fields like transportation and environmental sustainability, or a bachelor’s degree with one of our partner schools. career choice is just one way to give employees access to  the edu cation needed to take on in-demand, higher-paying  jobs. examples of other upskilling initiatives we offer include the amazon technical apprenticeship program, which helps military veterans transition into tech careers, with many apprentices converting into full-time employees with amazon, and machine learning university, which teaches machine learning capability to those with basic skills in software development. we view these as important investments in our employees and in the communities where we operate.  alongside career choice updates, we announced additional  new and e nhanced programs in  , including:   • surge it:  an update to our existing surge it program, with  a pilot t hat expanded it to employees with nontechnical  backgrounds who are interested in a career in it.   • sustainability training: we engaged  ,  employees  on sust ainability programming,  ,  of whom completed  training

employees can access escalation mechanisms through the ethics line, executive escalation, their manager, and hr business partners, to name a  few.  associate roundtables, forums, and  safety committees  associate roundtables are held regularly for leadership and  hourly employees to discuss pressing issues. associate forums create opportunities for employees to connect with site leaders on decisions that impact the site or employee experience. in  , we held more than   forums across the uk, poland, slovakia, czech republic, spain, and  morocco.  globally, various sites also

our employees’ right to form, join, or not join labor unions or other lawful organizations of their choosing, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. these rights should be exercised in an informed and thoughtful manner.  globally, amazon applies or is party to dozens of collective bargai ning agreements at national, regional, sectoral,  and enterprise levels. in  , we established a european works council; we held our first meeting in april  . in march  , we reaffirmed our position on freedom of associ ation  , including our approach to human rights and  collective bargaining.  looking forward  in the u.s., we are exploring new avenues for supporting employees’ financial health; in europe, we have set a   benefits roadmap that focuses on health care, finance, and time away

to scale training opportunities, adding additional resources to career choice and offering new programs. to prepare more employees for future sustainability roles, we are working to build new pathways for in-demand roles and programs to upskill our workforce.   we continually look to evolve the employee experience. to  understa nd where there’s room for growth, we will enhance  engagement channels

goal is to be the safest workplace across the industries  in which we operate. we use a risk management approach to guide our prioritization and decision-making, which includes:  • measuring safety performance to assess program effecti veness and to identify and remove hazards •assessing safety processes and adherence to standardsthrough au dits and inspections •engaging employees to continually improve safety inour operation s we use various measures to mitigate operational safety risks. we also inv est in high-impact solutions that make machines,  equipment, and processes safer, while implementing preventive measures such as training, standard operating procedures, and personal protective equipment.  our efforts are guided by a management system that aligns w ith international organization for standardization  (iso)  : —a voluntary international standard for health and safety management. to drive continuous improvement, we measure progress against two kinds of indicators:  •lagging indicators, such as incident rates. •leading indicators, which are preventive measures. our leadi ng indicators include data from inspections, assessments, audits, employee and leader surveys, one-to-one conversations, focus groups, and on-site observationsfrom employees. our progress  measuring safety  performance  data helps us assess the effectiveness of our efforts and  identify potential improvement areas. it also equips operations leaders and safety professionals with measurable, objective insights that support risk detection and mitigation. with this in mind, we track two metrics that help us understand annual safety performance:  •recordable inc ident rate (r ir): denotes how often an  injury or ill ness occurs at work—measured  in injuries per   ,  working h ours—according  to local occupat ional  safety and hea lth reporting requirements . •lost time inc ident rate (ltir): measur es the number of  injuries and illnesses per    ,  working hours that resu lt  in  time away from work.   when examining   against  , we are proud to report our global rir has improved by  %, while global ltir improved by  %.   between   and   alone, we  improved rir by  % and ltir by  %. of recordable incidents reported in  , about  % resulted from work-related musculoskeletal disorders. the remaining  % were primarily due to slips, trips, falls, and falling objects. progress since   is due, in large part, to our long-term strategy  for continuous improvement. many practices that  were underway prior to the pandemic—including employee engagement and physical and mental health support—continue to be foundational. and we’ve continued building on them with new technologies, including artificial intelligence (ai), robotics, sensors, and innovative engagement tools and learning methodologies.   as well as reducing rir and ltir, we work every day to help prev ent injuries and tragedies, such as fatalities, in our  workplaces. sadly, sometimes they do occur from personal health causes, natural disasters and work-related activity. in  , we lost three amazon employees in the u.s. to work-related fatalities, which is defined as an occupational injury or disease sustained or contracted during an employee’s tenure with their employer. we provide support and counseling to any employee who may need it following such a tragedy. in each instance, we conduct thorough internal investigations, implement corrective actions, and work with regulatory authorities as they conduct their own independent reviews.  while safety metrics include only amazon employees, we are also dri ving advancements for business partners within our  fulfillment, freight, and delivery networks.  learn more in our   safety, health, and well-being report  . safety

employee health and safety appendix  assessing safety processes  audits and inspections assure that effective resources and  protocols are in place for identifying, eliminating, or controlling safety hazards. during inspections, we check that our safety measures and controls are working to reduce or mitigate potential risk, as designed.  inspections include checks of critical safety controls for high-risk operations such as contractor maintenance, machinery use, maintenance and repair, dock and yard safety, and powered industrial truck operations. in  , we conducted over  .  million inspections globally, up from  .  million in  .  auditing verifies our compliance with national and international regulations and standards in over   jurisdictions globally. we  conduct audits for areas such as occupational health, safety management, and facility and technical safety. findings are tracked by our management system and used to identify root causes, improve compliance, and update internal standards and procedures.  did you know?  we encourage anyone interested in seeing our fulfillment facilities to sign up for one of our amazon tours, either virtually or in person. more than   million people experienced our tours in   and  . engaging employees  on safety  in  , we improved our employee-led safety observation  program to make it easier for employees to share suggestions and concerns. as well as representing another leading indicator against which to track progress, the observation program helps facilitate timely, meaningful conversations on safety topics, helping leadership engage with the issues that are most important to amazon employees. we are encouraged by the preliminary results we are seeing and the potential reduction in lagging indicators as a result of this program.  as well as providing effective communication routes, we seek to enhance understanding through safety trainings that help  people take ownership of their own safety. employees receive critical safety information on their first day of employment, followed by job- and process-path-specific training. during  , mental health awareness training was delivered to thousands of managers, with guidance on what to do if mental health concerns arise at work. we also enhanced our worldwide emergency response preparedness training with realistic emergency scenarios. this was further strengthened with an on-site tour to highlight visible cues and provide clear instruction on how to handle shelter or evacuation events.  learn more about how we engage employees on safety through  associate safety committees   .  our safety leadership index  in  , we created the safety leadership index (sli) to measure employee and leader perceptions of safety. the index helps us get ahead of safety risks by gathering feedback through monthly questions, delivered via employees’ scanners and computers.  questions cover topics such as sentiment around leaders’ safety commitment, saf ety awareness,  safety structures, safety involvement, and safety accountability. feedback is anonymous, confidential, and intended to drive improvement. in  , we engaged over  .  million operations employees through the sli across more than  ,  sites in   countries.    amazon sustainability report looking forward  we continue to invest in safety-related projects across amazon and will invest approximately $  million in  . these projects include capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered ergonomic solutions that aim to reduce and eliminate risks.  we are constantly striving to improve safety for our employees, partners, and communities every day. we know  there is more work to do on our journey to become the safest employer across the industries within which we operate. our commitment to safety has never been stronger—and it will only continue to grow.  amazon ceo, andy jassy, and ceo of worldwide amazon stores, doug  herrington,

experiences everywhere. amazon has changed the world through its focus on the customer—and we are approaching dei and accessibility the same way. our strategy focuses on using technology wherever possible to create inclusive experiences for employees, customers, and communities around the world.  • employee experience: guided by amazon’s leadership principles, we are committed to a culture that creates a safer, more productive, more diverse, and more just work environment. as a part of this, we are building equitable and inclusive experiences for our people, and into our products, processes, and programs.  • community experience: with our size, speed, and innovative culture, we take bold, deliberate action to drive change on a global scale. through our inclusive products, services, and touch points in neighborhoods around the world, amazon aims to be a leader in using science and data to help achieve a more equitable society for the future.  • customer experience: we work backward from our customers in everything we do. from deliveries at the front door to satellites in space, we are focused on creating accessible solutions that make life easier for people of all backgrounds. we set three priorities in  :  • accelerate inclusive experiences outside of the u.s.: we deliver global initiatives for indigenous people,  the lgbtqia+ community, military veterans and their spouses, and people with disabilities. we are making self-identification available in countries where amazon currently operates. where legally allowed, employees can voluntarily share their demographic characteristics, which helps us better understand their needs and drive more impactful programming.  • advance dei through technology: we see an opportunity to address the needs of the future by taking an approach  that blends human judgment and artificial intelligence. while it’s still early, we are already seeing that technology helps us inspect and remove potential bias from our people processes and improve human decision-making. this will help us accelerate our progress at scale across every aspect of the workplace.  • take a more holistic approach to dei in our talent strategy: we use data and science to find opportunities to improve the experience across the entire employee lifecycle, optimizing processes related to hiring, onboarding, professional development, promotion, and retention. this includes continued investment in our existing upskilling programs, such as our global mentorship program, and amazon technical academy, which trains nontechnical

are prioritizing three actions :  • driving impact globally by scaling existing diverse businesses and onboarding new ones  • partnering with global diversity advocacy organizations to engage more diverse suppliers in the sourcing proces s  • standardizing sdi operating procedures across the company and ensuring oversight  our progress  driving impact with  diverse businesses globally  through our sdi approach, we seek to include more diverse- owned and small businesses in our procurement processes.   in  , we focused on increasing the diversity of certified u.s. tier   suppliers—companies we contract with to provide  goods and services, such as marketing, construction, and professional services to operate our businesses .  we look to external organizations to confirm the diversity of our supply chain. being certified as a diverse supplier with amazon requires valid certification from one of five major u.s .  supplier diversity agencies: • the national minority supplier development council (nmsdc) or regional affiliate  • women’s business enterprise national council (wbenc) or regional affiliate  • national lgbt chamber of commerce (nglcc )  • national veteran business development council (nvbdc)  • disability:i n  amazon also accepts certifications from the u.s. small business administration’s (sba) hubzone program and  (a) business development program, and the

opportunities for women-owned businesses to work with amazon. we also joined two global supplier diversity agencies—weconnect international, the global certification body for women-owned businesses, and the canadian aboriginal and minority supplier council.  throughout the year, we hosted   regional in-person events for diverse and small business owners across the u.s., starting in connecticut before expanding to other states. our aim was to create opportunities for diverse suppliers to network with our procurement and leadership teams. we also hosted quarterly virtual webinars on “how to do business with amazon” and participated in virtual and in-person events to meet with diverse businesses. our largest virtual event was held in partnership with wbenc and was attended by   women-led business enterprises .  to expand our capacity for engagement, we attended various u.s. national and regional conferences for the first time, meeting with diverse business owners at nmsdc, wbenc, nglcc, nvbdc, and u.s. black chambers events . standardizing sdi  operating procedures and ensuring oversight  we depend on supply chain partners who reliably provide  goods and services across amazon to keep us running seamlessly. our supplier network spans the globe, and we want to drive our sdi efforts wherever we operate. throughout  , we continued building fundamental sdi procedures to meet industry best practices, gathering stakeholder insights and defining plans to expand sdi globally .  to make it easier to connect, in  , we launched supplier connect, a vendor registration portal which now has more than  ,  diverse suppliers registered,   of which ar e  certified by one of the five major u.s. supplier diversity agencies. we also offer amazon relay, a registration portal for freight carriers.  we recognize the importance of working with diverse businesses and are intentional about the certifications we accept. to ensure the integrity of our process, amazon validates certification documents for every diverse business included in our tier   diversity spend. we annually confirm certification  status for each of our diverse suppliers .  looking forward  amazon’s
