 sustainability report      american airlines sustainability report               indexes & data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message about american airlines and this report  american airlines group inc. is a holding company whose primary business   activity is the operation of a major network carrier headquartered in fort  worth, texas, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and  cargo through our mainline operating subsidiary, american airlines, inc.  and our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries, envoy aviation group  inc., psa airlines, inc. and piedmont airlines, inc., as well as contracted  third-party regional carriers. american airlines group inc. and our wholly- owned subsidiaries are hereafter referred to collectively as “american. ”   the term “regional carriers” refers only to those owned by american.american is committed to providing regular and transparent  information about our strategies and performance on the sustainability  issues that we believe are most important to our company and  stakeholders. this sustainability report includes a discussion of  american’s approach to managing those sustainability issues, along  with highlights of our progress and performance in sustainability in   . it covers the activities of american airlines group inc. that are  consolidated for financial reporting, except where specifically indicated  otherwise. unless noted otherwise, the performance data presented in  this report is for the   months ending dec.  ,  .adhering to best practices for disclosure, this report also substantially  aligns with the recommendations of the task force on climate-related  financial disclosures (tcfd)  and the standard for the airline industry  developed by the sustainability accounting standards board (sasb) .   we view both of these reporting frameworks as important indicators   of the sustainability issues that investors and others consider most  significant. regarding forward-looking statements, please see the last   page  of this report . human connection — in our personal lives, at work and within  our communities — is an imperative. the soaring demand for  travel as we emerge from the pandemic is a testament to that  quest for connection, and i’m honored and humbled to be part  of a company that exists to help people fulfill it. over the past year, american has worked tirelessly at putting  our assets to work to fly more and bring people together again.  i’m deeply proud of our team for building back our airline faster  than anyone, flying more people to more places and getting  the world moving again — all while remaining steadfastly  committed to our “why”: caring for people on life’s journey.  succeeding in this aim depends on american continuing to  run a reliable operation and thrive as a profitable enterprise.  but it also demands that we hold ourselves accountable as  exceptional stewards of the resources we are fortunate enough  to have and on which our success depends. our more than   ,  team members are committed to meeting the demand  for air travel and finding ways to do so more sustainably.attracting, retaining and developing the talent we need is  both important to american’s mission and a vital way we  create economic opportunity in our communities. we are  enormously proud of those efforts. indeed, we hired more  than  ,  new team members in  . and more than   ,  positions at american are front-line jobs represented  by unions, jobs that don’t require a four-year degree, yet  provide team members with what we believe are excellent  compensation and benefits and the chance to build stable,  rewarding careers. the shortage of pilots in our industry  has received a lot of attention, but we are equally in need  of talent to fill well-paying jobs across our company — from  maintenance technicians to flight attendants, reservation  agents and technology professionals. to help accomplish those objectives, we are working to  create opportunities and train people from all backgrounds,  including diverse groups historically underrepresented in  the airline industry. that effort includes developing a diverse  pilot applicant pool, including through our cadet academy,  pursuing partnerships with groups such as the aviation  institute of maintenance and the organization for black  aerospace professionals, and recruiting at historically black  colleges and universities. as we have undertaken record  hiring, we’re also seizing the moment to increase awareness,  access and opportunity for everyone interested in exploring  a career in aviation. and we have held ourselves accountable  for our progress by incorporating diversity goals into our  annual executive incentive plan. the outstanding team we’ve built at american is the engine  behind the high level of service we provide to our customers.  even as we rapidly ramped up our operation in  , we  maintained our focus on offering the reliability, dependability  a message   from our ceo ceo robert isom   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message and world-class experience our customers expect. thanks  to the hard work of our team, we recorded our best-ever  customer satisfaction scores — which we measure by  likelihood to recommend — for the year. and we aren’t  content to stop there, as we continually work to find new  and better ways to meet our customers’ needs.  addressing climate change risks also remains a critical  priority for american. whether it’s rising temperatures in  our sun belt hubs or the increasing prevalence of extreme  weather events across our system, this isn’t a distant threat.  it’s affecting our operations today. so, the question isn’t  whether we — as a company, industry, country or society  — need to make real changes, it’s about how quickly and  decisively we will do so. for our part at american, we have set bold and ambitious  climate goals, and are taking real steps to meet them.  over the past several years, we have undertaken the most  extensive fleet renewal effort in the history of our industry  — giving us the youngest mainline fleet among u.s. network  carriers. we became the first airline in the world to receive  validation from the science based targets initiative that   our   emissions reduction target complies with its  rigorous criteria.  we also continue to be a leader in the industry in our use  of sustainable aviation fuel (saf), almost doubling our  saf consumption in   compared to the year before.  alongside our investments in electric vertical takeoff and  landing aircraft, in  , we announced new investments  to catalyze the development of zero-carbon, hydrogen-fuel- cell-powered aviation. and we are developing and deploying  new technologies within our own operations — such as smart  gating — to reduce fuel use and emissions. i’m proud of the role american is playing in helping to  advance low-carbon aviation. and i’m excited about some  of the broader developments we’ve seen, including the saf  blenders tax credit that the u.s. congress included in the  inflation reduction act last year to help grow saf production.  but at the same time, i’m clear-eyed about the fact that  reaching net zero will require more collaboration across the  public and private sectors.  the fact is, american cannot achieve our climate goals  on our own. we can and are working to do our part and  hold ourselves accountable for our progress, but we need  advances in engine, aircraft and fuel technologies to get  there. we also need a policy and funding environment that  will enable these advances to be scaled, with the support of  a modernized and efficient airspace program. climate change, like all aspects of sustainability, is a reminder  that the challenges we face are interconnected. solving them  requires bringing people together and forging connections  across sectors, geographies, communities and ideologies.  that’s why we fly. robert isom   chief executive officer june     american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message indexes & data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message sustainability strategy we have long recognized the importance of environmental,  social and governance issues and have developed an  integrated and transparent approach to related oversight,  management, measurement and reporting. we believe we  have much to show for our efforts, but we continue to look to  best practices within and outside our industry as we refine  and strengthen our policies, practices and disclosures. our priority sustainability issues we periodically conduct sustainability-focused materiality  assessment processes that serve as the foundation of our  analysis of areas of sustainability risk and opportunity. we  conducted our most recent process in early  , which  incorporated a “double-materiality” approach, and affirmed  our priority issues. through ongoing engagement across our  company and with a broad range of external stakeholders,  we annually validate and, as needed, refine our assessment  based on the input we receive and changes in our operating  environment. we also continually monitor trends, standards  and practices relevant to our industry to inform our areas  of focus. additionally, we look to widely adopted external reporting frameworks, including the task force on climate- related financial disclosures and the sustainability accounting  standards board. we view both of these reporting frameworks  as important indicators of the sustainability issues that  investors and others consider most material. these activities have affirmed our focus on the following  priority sustainability issues: • safety • team member engagement, compensation and benefits • diversity, equity and inclusion (dei) • customer satisfaction and operational performance • climate change and fuel efficiency driving progress across all these issues is a key objective for  american. we also recognize that the business landscape is  evolving rapidly and that we must be ready to address new  areas of concern if and when they emerge. over time, we  have worked to develop a more integrated approach to our  management of key risks and opportunities. we will continue  to seek stakeholder input, while also closely monitoring  emerging practices and trends. in  , american airlines was the   only passenger airline named to the   dow jones sustainability north america  index  for the second straight year. we  increased our year-over-year score by  more than  %, which we believe is a  recognition of the progress we have made  toward our sustainability goals.sustainability strategy  as american rapidly ramped up operations in  , our focus on sustainability remained front and center. we  believe prioritizing the safety of our team members and customers, supporting and attracting diverse talent,  providing our customers with a world-class travel experience and positioning american to compete in a low- carbon economy are all integral to running a reliable operation and a profitable company that thrives forever.   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change safety ceo message sustainability  strategy management and governance  since sustainability issues touch nearly every aspect of our  business, their day-to-day management is an integral part  of our operations and functions. american’s vice president,  sustainability, is responsible for guiding and coordinating our  activities at the executive level, and she is supported by a team  of sustainability professionals. she also receives guidance and  feedback from a cross-functional and cross-operational group  of senior leaders with responsibility for regularly assessing the  effectiveness of our sustainability strategy, its implementation  and further integration of sustainability into our company  strategy and operations. (see in conversation: on the front  lines of sustainability at american airlines  on page   .) at the board level, the corporate governance and public  responsibility (cgpr) committee has primary responsibility  for overseeing most of our sustainability efforts, like climate  change. our compensation committee has oversight  responsibility for our human capital issues, including team  member compensation and benefits and engagement, talent  development and dei. our safety committee has primary  responsibility for oversight of american’s safety culture,  program and performance. among its many responsibilities,  our audit committee has oversight of our approach to business  conduct and ethics. our board received updates on each of  these topics at each quarterly board meeting in  , and our  full board reviews union relations, customer satisfaction and  operational performance regularly in its meetings. climate-related governance american takes a coordinated approach to ensuring we have  robust governance of climate-related risks and opportunities.  it begins with board-level oversight and accountability and  extends to our day-to-day operations. at the board level, the cgpr committee has oversight  responsibility for american’s climate change strategy. in  ,  this committee dedicated significant time to reviewing our  climate change risks and opportunities. we also review our  climate change strategy with the cgpr committee several  times throughout the year.  at the management level, we formally assigned responsibility for  oversight of our climate change strategy to our chief executive  officer in  . american’s vice president, sustainability, is  responsible for developing and coordinating the company’s  overall climate strategy and driving its implementation.  responsibility for climate-related issues is also embedded in  senior roles across our company. for example, the operations  team conducts resiliency planning for more frequent and  severe weather events; our fuel procurement team works  to secure cost-effective supplies of sustainable aviation fuel  (saf); and our flight operations and fleet engineering  teams are focused on improving fuel efficiency in the air and  on the ground. our climate change steering committee —  which is led by an executive vice president and includes  representatives from airport operations, flight operations,  technical operations, cargo, finance, safety, people,  communications, legal, government affairs and investor  relations — provides guidance across these efforts.  for more information on american’s corporate  governance policies and procedures, as well as  our standards of business conduct, please see  our website .public policy and political contributions political, legislative and regulatory decisions can have  a significant impact on american’s success, and we  have adopted policies that guide our participation  in these processes. reflecting best practices, our  statement on public policy engagement and political  participation  describes how management and the  board of directors oversee american’s public policy  engagement and the policy considerations that  influence such engagement. our board reviews this  statement regularly and last approved a revision in  january  . we do not use corporate funds to contribute to  candidates, political party committees or political  action committees. on the rare occasion when we use  corporate funds to contribute to a state or local ballot  initiative or a  (c)( ) organization, we have committed  to disclosing that contribution. american did not make  any such political or  (c)( ) contributions in  . the cgpr committee oversees the company’s  major advocacy priorities and activities, political  contributions and principal trade association  memberships. we have committed to aligning our  lobbying efforts with the priorities and goals of the  paris agreement, the international treaty on climate  change.  to help advance our net zero commitment, american  joined the low carbon fuels coalition (lcfc)  in  .  lcfc is a technology-neutral trade association with a  proven track record, which advocates on behalf of clean  fuel standards. (see page   for more information.)   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change safety ceo message sustainability  strategy jill blickstein, american’s vice president, sustainability,  looks back on   and discusses american’s evolving  sustainability strategy. as you look back on the past year, what progress  toward your   net zero goal are you most excited  about? and what has to happen next?  we’re seeing real progress in growing the market for sustainable  aviation fuel (saf). in  , we signed an agreement to buy    million gallons of saf from gevo, a new producer. and congress  enacted the first-ever tax credit aimed at increasing investment in  saf. to ramp up saf production, saf producers will need both  the demand signal and the requisite public policy support. i’m also excited about the progress we’re seeing in hydrogen. in   , american invested in two start-ups working to advance  zero-emissions aviation powered by green hydrogen, both of  which have met major milestones recently. the united states is  investing in green hydrogen, and while it’s far in the future, we  want aviation to be able to take advantage of that growth. that takes me to the second part of your question. we’re  making progress, but we can’t reach net zero on our own.  we need government and private industry working together  to support alternative fuels. i’m not necessarily talking about  direct collaboration, but i do mean everybody working toward  the same goal. in the case of saf, that means producing    billion gallons in   to fuel the entire u.s. airline industry.  fortunately, there has been a lot of good news on that front,   and we expect to see more. how does american’s capital spending align with your  climate strategy? investors have started asking that question as well. i’ll start by  saying that no airline can spend its way to net zero. getting  there is going to require advances in airframe, engine and fuel  technologies, along with a policy environment that enables them  to scale. that said, roughly  % of our total capital expenditure  budget for   went toward projects that yield decarbonization  benefits, even if the efforts themselves also serve other purposes.  that includes about $ .  billion for new, more fuel-efficient aircraft  and initiatives such as electric ground support equipment and  retrofitting existing aircraft with lighter seats. we have also  committed to investing $  million as an anchor partner in  breakthrough energy catalyst . are there other aspects of your sustainability strategy  where you are seeing progress?  there are too many to mention here, but that’s why we produce  an entire report. i am proud, though, of the work we are doing  to diversify the flight deck. our team members are american’s  biggest strength, and i’m glad to be part of a leadership team  that seeks to recruit top talent from all backgrounds. we have  initiatives focused on training the next generation of pilots as well as aircraft maintenance technicians. both are generally  well-paying careers with opportunities for advancement. we  need new minds to help solve today’s challenges, and for a goal  as big as decarbonizing our operation, it’s all hands on deck. after several years of publishing an esg report,  what was behind american’s decision to call this a  sustainability report instead? as we’ve deepened and matured our work across a range of  nonfinancial issues, we’ve come to believe that “sustainability”  better captures our purpose. that’s because it takes into account  both risk management — which is at the core of esg and a critical  priority for american — and our impact on the environment  in which we operate. we recognize that american’s long-term  success is linked inextricably to the health of the planet and the  people we serve. that’s how we define sustainability.  in conversation:   on the front lines  of sustainability   at

achieve net zero greenhouse gas (ghg)  emissions by  . to drive progress toward that goal, we  have set an intermediate target to reduce ghg emissions  intensity by  % by  , relative to a   baseline. this  includes both direct emissions (scope  ) — which are  primarily from the jet fuel used in flight — and the emissions  from the production of the jet fuel the airline uses and the  consumption of jet fuel by contracted regional carriers. in  , we became the first airline globally to receive  validation from the science based targets initiative (sbti)  that  our intermediate   ghg reduction targets comply with  the sbti criteria. american submitted its intermediate targets  under the sbti’s first aviation pathway, published in august   , which was designed to limit warming to well-below  °c  above preindustrial levels, the temperature goal outlined in  the paris agreement.  our strategy for reaching net zero ghg emissions by    is focused on running an ever more fuel-efficient operation,  primarily by operating more fuel-efficient aircraft that are  increasingly powered by low-carbon fuel. in  , we took  meaningful steps forward in these areas — from adding  new-generation aircraft to our fleet and finalizing our most  significant sustainable aviation fuel (saf) offtake agreement to  date, to announcing two investments in companies focused on  the development of low-carbon, hydrogen-powered aviation.  our climate strategy  our strategy to reach net zero emissions is focused on driving  progress across several key levers — some of which we have  the ability to influence directly, and some of which will require  action and collaboration within our industry, across sectors  and by policymakers.  underpinning our strategy is the in-depth analysis we initially  conducted in   to understand the climate-related risks and  opportunities facing our company. in early  , we further  expanded and deepened this analysis by incorporating  . °c  aligned scenarios, consistent with the ambition of the paris  agreement, in our assessment of both physical and transition  risks. this includes the international energy agency’s (iea)  net zero by   (nze) scenario, which we selected because  it includes aviation-specific narrative and milestones. for a  detailed discussion of our process and findings, see page  . our carbon footprint in  * total emissions

data customers team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message working to make zero-carbon, hydrogen   fuel cell-powered flight a reality  decarbonizing aviation will require low- or zero-carbon  fuel sources that can generate the significant power  aircraft engines need — and that can be practically  distributed to, and carried on, the commercial aircraft  that will be coming into service in the next decade. major  challenges remain in making hydrogen available for  commercial aviation, but hydrogen offers the potential to  become a game-changing fuel source. while hydrogen contains nearly three times more energy  per unit of weight than jet fuel, it has less energy per unit  of volume. this low volumetric energy density means that  on board an aircraft, hydrogen would require too much  space and, therefore, would need to be stored as a liquid  to provide sufficient energy for longer-range flights. and  the aviation community — airports, airlines and hydrogen  producers — would need to develop a new supply chain  to produce and deliver hydrogen to aircraft. however,  hydrogen has a safe and successful track record as a  transportation fuel in hydrogen-powered cars and buses.  and it produces only water vapor as a byproduct when  used in a fuel cell, since the fuel has no carbon content to  start with.  american is helping to catalyze the development of  hydrogen-electric propulsion technology — through  which hydrogen is used in fuel cells — as well as the  future of hydrogen distribution logistics. in  , we  announced strategic investments in zeroavia, a pioneer  in hydrogen-electric, zero-emission aviation powerplants,  and universal hydrogen, a company building a green  hydrogen distribution and logistics network for mobility  applications, starting with commercial aviation.zeroavia: hydrogen-electric propulsion for aviation zeroavia’s novel zero-emissions, hydrogen-electric  powertrain replaces traditional engines on existing fixed-wing  aircraft. the powertrains use green hydrogen, which is stored  in tanks and converted to electricity in flight using a fuel cell,  which then powers the electric motors. the green hydrogen  is produced through electrolysis — powered by locally  generated renewable energy — and stored at or near airports. zeroavia is working to retrofit and linefit its powertrains to  existing faa-certified fixed-wing aircraft, which simplifies  regulatory issues and reduces time to market. in early   , zeroavia flew the maiden flight of its  -seat dornier    testbed aircraft, retrofitted with a full-size prototype  hydrogen-electric powertrain on the left wing of the aircraft.  by the early  s, the company has its sights set on flying  aircraft with  –  seats and a range in excess of  ,   nautical miles.universal hydrogen: green hydrogen distribution universal hydrogen is working to build a flexible and scalable  approach to hydrogen logistics by transporting it in modular  capsules over the existing freight network from green  production sites to airports around the world. at the airport,  the modules are loaded directly into the aircraft using existing  cargo-handling equipment. universal hydrogen anticipates entering into revenue service  in  , with plans to expand its services to larger, single-aisle  aircraft — first for auxiliary power and then as a primary fuel  by the mid- s. the company is also developing conversion  kits to retrofit regional airplanes with a hydrogen fuel cell  powertrain to serve as a solid proof point for a new clean- sheet single-aisle aircraft. in early  , universal hydrogen successfully completed a test  flight of a  -passenger, hydrogen-powered regional airliner,  the largest hydrogen fuel cell-powered airplane to take to the  skies and the largest airplane to cruise principally on hydrogen.hydrogen energy is transported to be  stored at or near airports renewable energy is generated

— and associated operations as efficiently as  possible is key to achieving our climate goals. we have a  target to achieve a   million-gallon absolute reduction in  jet fuel use by  , using   aircraft as a baseline, which  will avoid almost  ,  metric tons of co₂e. that means  aircraft in our fleet as of january   that continue to fly  through   will use   million gallons less fuel as a result  of fuel-efficiency initiatives. reducing excess weight is one of the best ways to reduce  ghg emissions because the weight of an aircraft is a critical  driver of how much fuel it uses. we have taken a number  of steps — from installing lighter seats and removing seat- back entertainment systems to using lighter paint — that  collectively save millions of gallons of fuel and associated  emissions each year. in  , we kicked off a significant effort in partnership  with safran landing systems to upgrade our boeing  -   fleet — which includes more than   aircraft currently  in operation — from steel to lighter-weight carbon brakes.  carbon brakes provide up to   pounds of weight savings  per aircraft, reducing fuel use and avoiding   metric tons of  ghg emissions per aircraft per year. we estimate that over a   -year period, this investment will avoid more than  ,   metric tons of co e. we look for opportunities to implement operational changes  that reduce on-the-ground fuel use as well, such as using  just one aircraft engine to taxi to the gate after landing, which we estimate reduces emissions by up to  %. we are  also finding opportunities to transition our ground support  equipment (gse) to run on electric power. by the end of   ,  % of our gse was electric. and, recently, we started  using renewable diesel to fuel our gse at some locations. optimizing how we assign gates to reduce taxi time is  another way to reduce fuel use, and in  , we began  implementing “smart gating” technology developed by  american. the new technology uses real-time data from a  wide variety of sources to reduce gate conflicts, taxi time  and airport congestion. in the process, it reduces fuel use  and associated ghg emissions. we used this technology  at dallas fort worth international airport (dfw), charlotte  douglas international airport (clt) and miami international  airport (mia) in  . smart gating is projected to save over   .  million gallons of fuel per year at these three locations  alone, while reducing co₂ emissions by more than  ,   metric tons annually. in the first half of  , we expanded  smart gating to ronald reagan washington national airport  and chicago o’hare international airport. focusing on flying as efficiently as possible, including  considering everything from the speed and paths our aircraft  take on departure and descent to how flight crews adjust en  route to account for changing weather conditions, is another  way we save fuel and reduce ghg emissions. we are also  working to understand how we can efficiently adjust flight  paths to avoid contrails, which may contribute to aviation’s  impact on climate change. (see advancing scalable  solutions to avoid contrails at right.)advancing scalable solutions to   avoid contrails there’s an emerging scientific consensus that the net  impact of contrails — the condensation trails of ice  clouds that can form when a plane’s hot, humid exhaust  mixes with cool, humid air high in the atmosphere —  from aviation may have a warming impact as great or  greater than the warming caused by the co  emitted by  aviation’s use of petroleum jet fuel. persistent contrails  formed during the late afternoon and evening may have  a particularly large warming effect.  american is helping lead the way toward developing  scalable, cost-effective solutions to contrails avoidance.  in  , we joined the contrails impact task force, a  cross-sectoral initiative that brings together aviation  industry, academic, technology and nonprofit partners  to tackle the climate challenge of contrails. convened  by rmi, a nonprofit environmental organization, and  breakthrough energy, the goal of the task force is to  share and expand on the latest science on the climate  impact of contrails, develop actionable strategies to  avoid warming contrails, analyze the operational and  financial challenges of implementing potential solutions,  and establish a roadmap for implementation and  validation of contrail mitigation tools.   american airlines

made in collaboration with the u.s.  federal aviation administration (faa), which oversees our  nation’s airspace system. one example of how we help to  drive these improvements is our partnership with the faa  and nasa on nasa’s airspace technology demonstration    (atd- ). american worked closely with nasa on the trial  program in charlotte, north carolina, which was designed to  test and validate the benefits of terminal flight data manager  infrastructure, including how it can save fuel, reduce carbon  emissions and increase information-sharing between the faa  and industry. during the four-year demonstration project at  clt, atd-  saved more than  .  million gallons of fuel and  ,   tons of co .   the project was awarded the   sustainability maverick  award presented by world atm congress. the faa is in the  process of implementing the program in around   airports,  and it projects that the annual co  savings will equal  ,   tons when the project is fully implemented.    https://www.worldatmcongress.org/maverick-awards  modernizing our airspace system modernizing the country’s network of aviation infrastructure,  technology and services will increase operational efficiency   and reduce jet fuel use. in turn, that will avoid millions of  metric tons of co  emissions annually and help reduce aviation’s  carbon footprint. american is working collaboratively with the  faa — and advocating through the policymaking process —  for resources to accelerate the deployment of measures that  are both cost-effective and will yield immediate and long-term  environmental benefits.  one of these is unlocking automatic dependent surveillance– broadcast in (ads-b in) capability on aircraft that are equipped  to take advantage of this technology. ads-b in leverages  satellite-enabled navigation instead of outdated radar systems  to deliver weather and traffic position information directly to the  flight deck. that allows pilots to optimize flight paths, particularly  in low-visibility conditions, which reduces emissions and enhances safety. currently, the faa requires use of ads-b   out — which works by broadcasting information about an  aircraft’s gps location, altitude, ground speed and other data to  ground stations and other aircraft — but not ads-b in. other recent airspace initiatives include setting new criteria for  commercial space launches and releasing new high-altitude  routes along the eastern seaboard, which aim to reduce airspace  congestion. when airspace is congested, flights often have to  take longer routes, are put into holding patterns or even have to  divert to alternate airports — which can increase fuel use and  emissions significantly. therefore, reducing airspace congestion  can help reduce and avoid emissions. through our membership in the international air transportation  association (iata), the trade association for the world’s airlines, we  also support reforms to the global airspace system that will enable  more efficient flight operations and reduced ghg emissions.we were recognized for our sustainability  efforts as the   eco-airline of the year  by air transport world (atw), a

climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message sustainable aviation fuel aiming to significantly increase our use of saf — which  reduces life cycle ghg emissions by as much as  %  compared to conventional, petroleum-based jet fuel — is a  core part of american’s strategy to achieve net zero ghg  emissions. it is also key to achieving the in-sector reductions  required to meet our science-based target for  . we have set a goal to replace  % of our jet fuel use with saf  by  , avoiding approximately  .  million metric tons of co .  we are taking steps to achieve this by putting into place firm  saf offtake commitments that enable saf producers to raise  the capital necessary to build new production capacity, while  helping provide american with the saf supply we require to  meet our goals. in  , we finalized an agreement to purchase    million gallons of saf from biofuel company gevo, with  deliveries scheduled to commence in  . (see reducing the  carbon intensity of saf  on page  ). by the end of the year,  we had commitments covering more than   million gallons of saf from  – , which will fulfill nearly  % of our    saf goal. to meet these commitments, our development- stage partners will need to be able to develop and operate  commercial-scale facilities. in  , we used more than  .  million gallons of saf on our  flights, almost doubling our saf consumption compared to   . we continue to be a leader in saf consumption as one of  the few airlines to report using more than   million gallons a year. as critical as saf is for achieving our own and our industry’s  climate goals, it is not yet available at the scale or price  needed to reduce aviation’s emissions significantly. scaling  saf production to the point where it can materially reduce  our industry’s emissions and be cost competitive will take the  combined efforts of the private and public sectors. american continues to advocate for governments to deploy  policy tools, including incentives, credits and investments in  research, to create the market conditions needed to make saf an economically viable alternative to conventional jet fuel.  in  , we joined the low carbon fuels coalition (lcfc)  — a technology-neutral trade association that advocates for  scientifically based, marketplace-driven, low-carbon fuel policies  — to help american and the aviation industry as a whole move  closer to reaching net zero. we also voiced support for specific  policies designed to boost saf production and make it more  cost competitive, including the saf blenders tax credit that the  u.s. congress included in the inflation reduction act of  . another way we are helping build the saf market is as an  anchor partner in breakthrough energy catalyst (catalyst),  which is working to accelerate decarbonization efforts by  investing in innovative new technologies, including saf   and green hydrogen. american has committed to investing   $  million in these efforts. in  , catalyst invested   $  million to help lanzajet — a saf producer using novel  alcohol-to-jet technology — build a demonstration plant that  will be critical to scaling production. expanding reporting to include biogenic emissions a key part of our net zero strategy is sourcing fuels from biomass, such as plants, grasses, plant oils  and animal fats. since the biomass was grown by absorbing co  from the atmosphere, the fuels do  not add co  to the atmosphere when combusted. emissions from these biomass-based fuels are  considered biogenic emissions and are reported differently from fossil emissions. the co  portion  of biogenic emissions is reported as its own category that is separate from scope   since, unlike the  combustion of petroleum-based fuels, these emissions are not adding to net atmospheric co  levels.  the remaining ghg emissions, which are ch  and n o, are reported in scope   in co  equivalents.  there are also upstream emissions associated with converting biomass into saf. growing, harvesting  and transporting biomass and processing it into saf all emit ghgs that need to be accounted for  in the life cycle emissions of

climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message reducing the carbon intensity of saf saf has the potential to dramatically reduce life cycle ghg  emissions compared to conventional, petroleum-based jet  fuel. but exactly how much saf reduces emissions depends  on the feedstock, and the technologies and techniques  used to produce it. realizing the positive benefits of saf  depends on whether it is sustainably produced — in ways  that significantly reduce carbon intensity, and also by using  feedstocks and methods that don’t compete with food  production or contribute to deforestation, biodiversity loss   or other adverse impacts. american is prioritizing working with saf suppliers that  integrate sustainability considerations throughout their  processes — from the feedstocks they use to the energy  sources that power their operations. as a result, we have  developed partnerships with a range of innovative saf  producers and sustainability leaders that are pioneering the  development of new saf pathways that could hold the promise  of a net zero — or even net-negative — carbon footprint. for example, we have an agreement to purchase up to    million gallons of carbon-neutral saf produced by  prometheus fuels, which uses a novel process to make net  zero carbon transportation fuels. and we have an agreement  to take delivery of   million gallons of saf annually over   a seven-year period beginning in   from aemetis. it will   be produced at the aemetis carbon zero plant using  renewable hydrogen, renewable hydroelectric electricity   and renewable feedstocks. gevo: a circular economy approach to   producing fuel — and food  gevo is a company that is developing production facilities  to produce liquid hydrocarbons — including saf — from  renewable carbon and energy sources. in  , american  committed to purchasing   million gallons of saf over  five years from gevo, with deliveries expected to start in  .  gevo is a key player in the development and commercialization  of renewable hydrocarbons and chemicals, offering a circular  economy approach to decreasing the use of fossil fuels that  aligns with american’s goals of reducing carbon intensity. one  notable aspect of gevo’s approach is its focus on sustainability  throughout the entire production chain. gevo designed its process to use residual starch  from industrial field corn, which is then converted to  saf using an ethanol-to-jet pathway. gevo prioritizes  sustainability at every step of its process, first by  working with farmers who use regenerative agriculture  and sustainable farming techniques.  gevo’s saf production process will separate the elements  of the corn, using the protein to create high-value nutrition  products and corn oil, and using the starch for saf and  other fuels and chemicals. the production process is  designed to reduce waste and ghg emissions further by  using renewable energy, including electricity from wind  turbines and renewable natural gas, to power its facility.  as part of its circular economy model, gevo actively searches  for opportunities to decarbonize its processes, collaborating  with farmers to explore techniques that improve yield, reduce  emissions, sequester carbon in the soil and increase the  efficiency of every acre. by seeking partnerships to advance  the use of renewable energy, including saf and other renewable fuels, renewable natural gas, green hydrogen, wind  power, solar energy and more, gevo expects to continue to  enhance the sustainability of all its products and processes.  it will also pass the benefit of decreased fossil fuel use on to  its customers, such as american and the approximately    million passengers we carry each year.   american

climate scenario analysis in   that focused on  identifying and assessing the physical and transition climate- related risks and opportunities facing the company over the  short, medium and long term. in   and early  , we  continued to build on this by undertaking a more detailed  analysis of these risks and opportunities. this included adding   . °c scenarios into our assessment, as well as expanding  the number of sites included in the physical risk evaluation,  exploring geographic regions around the world in which we  operate that are projected to experience greater impacts, and  examining more closely the effects of potential changes in  policy, technologies and markets. the insights from this process, conducted in alignment with  the recommendations of the task force on

(see box at right for more information on the climate scenarios  we use for both our transition and physical risk assessments.) the transition scenarios compare different possible versions  of the future and the levers and actions that produce them,  with the aim of stimulating insights about the future of global  energy. we used these scenarios to explore elements of  the organizational resilience of american’s own business  operations as well as the resilience of our value chain, such as  upstream supplier reliability during extreme weather events  and saf production capacity. as part of the scenario analysis,  we also looked at downstream customer behavior changes  and how american’s climate ambitions might capture these  changes and manifest them as opportunities.  the table

organization  is working to protect elephants, rhinos, monkeys and other  endangered species from the illegal wildlife trade that is  pushing them toward extinction. this global criminal enterprise is worth an estimated $  billion   annually, with poachers and traffickers trading in a wide  variety of endangered wildlife and wildlife body parts,  generally for sale as trophies or for purported medicinal  uses. that can include rhino horn, ivory, pangolin scales  and tiger parts. their activities are a major threat to wildlife  conservation, global biodiversity and human health, and  they are linked to money laundering, corruption and extreme  violence, as well as the trafficking of drugs and weapons.  as a signatory of the united for wildlife transport taskforce  buckingham palace declaration, american will devote  resources to disrupting the illegal wildlife trade. among the buckingham palace declaration’s   commitments,  we have pledged to increase awareness among team members  about the nature, scale and consequences of these activities.  american will also improve the training of team members  to help them identify and report suspected illegal wildlife  trade, and we will encourage our airline partners and cargo  customers to do the same. to help enforcement agencies  identify potential shipments of suspected illegal wildlife and  their products, we will also

team members and contractors are also encouraged to ask  questions and report safety hazards, concerns and incidents  without fear of retaliation.  safety governance and management an uncompromising commitment to safety, security and  continuous improvement is a shared responsibility — from  our board of directors to frontline team members. our  chief executive officer retains ultimate responsibility  and authority for safety culture and performance, while  the board’s safety committee has formal oversight  responsibilities for safety. the board receives monthly  updates on key safety performance metrics and multiple  detailed reviews throughout the year.our safety management system our approach to safety is guided by our safety management  system (sms), an organization-wide approach to identifying  and managing risk. american was the first u.s. carrier to  pioneer an sms, in  . it has since been incorporated   into federal aviation administration (faa) regulations for   all carriers.  our sms emphasizes safety management as a fundamental  business process across the enterprise. it involves a full  commitment from the most senior leaders through to each  team member to integrate safety into how we do our jobs.  our sms promotes a culture in which our team members  proactively identify, analyze and manage risks. the sms  ensures robust and repeatable processes with local  ownership, driven by data to reduce risks and continuously  improve and enhance safety. we collaborate closely with  the faa to maintain operational safety at the highest level  possible and actively share best practices with our industry  peers, governments and aerospace manufacturers. the four  components of our sms are noted in the accompanying box.operating safely american

and key performance indicators. part of  our sms foundation, this policy helps to create a culture  that encourages effective management of risk along with  continuous improvement. the safety policy complies with all  applicable regulatory requirements and laws in the countries  where we operate and establishes standards for acceptable  operational behavior. in addition, our safety policy  is actively communicated to all team members and regularly updated to  promote occupational health and safety. our emergency response manual (erm), which establishes  effective and efficient response practices for various types of  emergencies — including natural disasters — is an integral  part of our sms. the erm serves as the governing document  for the american airlines corporate emergency response  plan. it includes guidelines to prepare for and respond to  emergencies, responsibilities for team members, protocols for  communicating with internal and external stakeholders, and  mechanisms to report emergencies. the erm also includes a  detailed pandemic preparedness and response plan that was  instrumental in helping us navigate through every phase of  the covid-

of each day and will continue to  work to provide the safest environment for our team members  and customers by continually improving and enhancing our  approach to safety. the overall goal of team member reporting is to improve safety  awareness and identify operational deficiencies by facilitating  an open line of communication between employees and  management without fear of reprisal. potential safety concerns  and suggestions identified through our many safety reporting  programs are critical to early identification of hazards. these  reports also allow the company to proactively address potential  risks and implement corrective actions to resolve safety and  security issues. when a team member identifies any safety-related concern,  he or she is encouraged to report the issue. once the concern  is received, skilled safety investigators collaborate with  operational partners to review the information provided,  assess the hazard and develop corrective actions to ensure  the issue is addressed. these reports are then reviewed as  part of the broader sms to determine if there are system- related risks developing. we follow up with the reporter to communicate what we learned and what steps we are taking  to prevent similar concerns from arising again. this follow- through and prompt action helps encourage additional  reporting, thus creating a robust safety reporting life cycle. our most prominent safety reporting initiatives include the  following: aviation safety action programs (asaps), ground  safety action programs, flight operations quality assurance,  the international air transport association's (iata's)  operational safety audit, line operations safety audits,   and the learning and improvement team. safety action programs everyone at american has a role to play in ensuring that our  people, customers and assets remain safe. through asaps,  team members can confidentially report potential hazards  and mistakes without concern of fault or fear of punitive  action, thus reinforcing a learning culture and improving our  operations along the way.  american was the first airline to create an asap, and now  such programs are commonplace among airlines worldwide.  currently, we have asaps for our flight, flight service,  dispatch, technical operations, central load planning and  ground (fleet service and cargo) teams, which we believe  gives us significantly greater coverage than the industry  average.  in  , we recorded  ,  asap reports, a  % increase  over  , corresponding with the significant ramp-up in  our operations. our ground asap, which we launched in   , quickly established itself by recording the third-largest  number of reports among our six programs in  . that  represents an  % year-over-year increase. an increase in  asap reports is a welcome trend, providing evidence that our safety program is working as anticipated. team members  are comfortable raising concerns when they see them, which  provides us with more opportunities to resolve them. flight operations quality assurance flight operations quality assurance (foqa) is a voluntary  safety program administered jointly by american and the  allied pilots association (apa) that uses routinely recorded  flight data to proactively identify and correct deficiencies in  flight operations. we routinely monitor all our flights and use  algorithms to look for potential safety risks and trends. the  results allow us to monitor aircraft systems, performance and  operational efficiency and help us to better understand pilot  performance in the operating environment.  to enhance foqa’s effectiveness, american partnered with  collins aerospace in   to retrofit our narrowbody aircraft  with its aircraft interface device (aid). as of february   ,  % of our fleet was equipped with this wireless data  transfer system. we expect that american’s entire fleet will  be outfitted by the end of  . aid improves the speed   with which we can retrieve foqa data, and it represents   an important tool to increase accuracy in monthly reporting,  improving aircraft reliability and preparing for future  products and capabilities.  in  , american also became the first carrier in the united  states to adopt cefa aviation mobile services, a cloud-based  application that allows pilots to recreate their flights on their  company ipad. this tool improves on the concept of crew  post-flight debriefing by providing real-time feedback to our  pilots, turning each flight into a learning opportunity and  ultimately contributing to the safety assurance of our sms.    american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change sustainability  strategy ceo message safety iata's operational safety audit  as part of our commitment to transparency and monitoring,  we are a registered participant in the iata's operational  safety audit (iosa) program, an internationally recognized  evaluation system designed to assess an airline’s operational  management and control systems. an iosa, which takes  place every two years, creates a structured methodology with  standardized checklists that are comparable on a worldwide  basis, enabling and maximizing the joint use of audit reports.  in april  , we successfully completed our iosa in  conformance with all standards and recommended  practices. iata modified its audit methodology this year  to be risk-based. as part of our efforts to be an industry  leader, american volunteered to be the first u.s. carrier to  participate under this new approach. line operations safety audits since launching our continuous pilot line operations safety  audits (losa) program in  , we have been sending  highly trained pilot observers onto the flight deck to better  understand work-as-done versus work-as-imagined.  observing our frontline team members in action and  gathering safety-related data on environmental conditions,  operational complexities and crew performance in real time  provides us with valuable insights for enhancing safety and  resilience. in  , our pilot losa observers conducted    flight deck observations, a  % increase compared with  . american has expanded losa to other workgroups as well.  we implemented a continuous dispatch losa in late    and were able to conduct   observations in  . we have  also been developing a cabin losa program and expect to  begin conducting observations by the middle of  . this  program will help us better understand the challenges facing our flight attendants and the measures we can take to keep  the cabin safe for everyone. we will continue to evaluate the  feasibility of expanding losa to other operational groups,  with  % coverage as our ultimate goal. learning and improvement team we created the learning and improvement team (lit) in    to collect and analyze data — falling under what is  often referred to as a safety   program — on what makes our  pilots successful in their everyday work. lit is composed of  line pilots who are specially trained to conduct flight deck  observations and facilitated discussions. while it is similar  in some ways to losa, lit is a separate program. one  of the key differences between lit and american’s other  flight sms programs (i.e., asap, foqa, losa) is that lit  focuses on what goes well and why, thus providing a new  safety lens through which to view the operation. combining  lit data with other sms data provides american with a  broader picture of the system, rather than looking solely at  unwanted outcomes. in  , we expanded the number of  lit navigators from six to  . they conducted   flight deck  observations and   one-on-one pilot interviews, which we  call “shop talks. ” safety risk management the safety risk management (srm) element of our sms  provides a decision-making process for identifying hazards  and mitigating risk based on a thorough understanding of  our systems and their operating environment. srm enables  us to consider the risks in our operations and reduce them  to an acceptable level. we use the srm process whenever  there is a significant change to our operations, such as  delivery of a new type of aircraft or the addition of a new airport to our network. we also apply srm when our safety  assurance process identifies a new hazard or an ineffective  control of an existing hazard. we use several tools to identify hazards and evaluate the  need for new or revised risk controls. the process of risk  management is the same regardless of the trigger or event,  and our sms looks at multiple factors for risk. while the faa  requirements are geared toward flight safety, our sms goes  further to evaluate a wider range of global risks, including  operational disruptions. peer support for pilots project wingman, established by american and the  apa, provides our pilots and their family members with  a discreet, peer-to-peer  /  helpline for reaching out  to other pilots for emotional and occupational support.  this program is managed by a deputy chair of the apa  aeromedical committee, and american employs a pilot  at the managerial level on a full-time basis to support  and promote it. more than   pilots currently volunteer for project  wingman. in addition to bringing a unique understanding  of the challenges pilots can face in their professional and  personal lives, these volunteers all undergo specialized,  intensive training. as a result, they are well-positioned  to know when to listen and provide encouragement or  recommend other resources when a situation warrants  greater intervention.    american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change sustainability  strategy ceo message safety safety promotion safety culture is the foundation of any sms, with trust at the  core. at american we believe in a just culture approach,  which encourages each team member to take responsibility  and have accountability for achieving the highest safety  standards and results. this approach, which we have  championed for more than a decade and has since become  an accepted aviation industry standard, encourages team  members to report errors, risky decisions or omissions  without fear of punitive actions. we train our teams to look at  potential safety events using three types of behavior: human  errors, at-risk behavior and reckless behavior.  safety training among new safety training initiatives in  , we  successfully launched two classes certified by the american  red cross through our learning hub. the first offered  certification in first aid, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr)  and use of an automated external defibrillator (aed). this  eight-hour class certified   members. a four-hour cpr/ aed class certified another  . we expect team member  certifications to increase significantly in  . with the  addition of a red cross-certified “train-the-trainer” option  through our in-house qualified instructor, we will train team  members to teach first aid and cpr/aed on-site across our  key hub locations. our ramp agents have the highest rate of injuries among  all team member groups, primarily as the result of lifting  baggage, often in awkward and tight spaces. working  with pristine condition international, which introduced the  science of olympic weightlifting techniques to industry, we  conduct training programs on proper lifting techniques.  in  , pristine also began training flight attendants and  aircraft maintenance team members, who suffer the second-  and third-highest injury rates, respectively. pristine also  developed and delivered targeted training to groups with  specific areas of opportunity. staysafe and safety engagement tool staysafe is a safety communications campaign implemented  across our airport and technical operations organizations. its  materials focus on lessons learned and ways to prevent team  member injuries and equipment damage. any bulletins or  alerts are available across multiple platforms in order to reach  the greatest number of team members affected. through our safety engagement tool, we are bringing  company leadership to the front lines to engage in  conversations with team members. managers can  communicate safety expectations, assess risks in the  operation and reinforce safe behaviors. for detailed safety performance data,   see page  .   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data customers team members climate change

our employee  business resource groups and inclusion councils from outside speakers and fireside chats to listening  sessions, creating a more inclusive environment by engaging  team members is a top priority. one way we do this is through  our employee business resource groups (ebrgs), company- wide team member resource groups that serve as networks  and information resources for all our team members. american’s ebrgs serve as networks for team members  to connect, foster professional and personal development,  learn through cultural engagement activities, serve our  communities and help support american’s business  objectives. american currently has   ebrgs with   local  chapters, and they represent a range of communities with  different beliefs, genders, ethnicities and life experiences.  in  , more than  ,  team members belonged to at  least one ebrg. we expect our senior leaders to model our  commitment to dei by taking an active leadership role in  ebrgs or other dei-related programs.  our ebrgs host and sponsor a variety of programs and  events each year that benefit team members as well as the  communities where they are based. for example, our pride  ebrg

way in which we are working  to advance our dei strategy and promote an inclusive culture.  since  , we have established inclusion councils across  seven different workgroups. they are designed to elicit team  member feedback in the workplace, develop workgroup- specific learning and mentorship programs, and drive action in  policymaking. in  , our inclusion councils hosted nearly    listening sessions, developed action plans and helped influence  policy changes. for example, they worked with unions and our  flight team to promote gender-neutral flight policies.promoting fairness through a commitment to pay equity american has long championed pay equity, and we are  committed to pay parity for the same job regardless of gender,  race or ethnicity. the  % of our workforce that is covered by  collective bargaining agreements has built-in pay equity as  part of those agreements. therefore, we have focused on pay  equity for the remaining  % — made up of leadership and  support staff — who do not belong to unions. american has been using syndio’s workplace equity platform  since  . as a result, we have fine-tuned our methodology for  completing regular pay equity reviews, including most recently  in early  . our approach begins by placing each team  member in one of approximately   “similarly situated groups” (ssgs) across american based on the type of work they do. we  then identify factors that can drive compensation variation within  each ssg, such as an individual’s specific pay scale, seniority  or experience. of course, higher salaries awarded to any new or  existing team members can result in unintended pay gaps.  in  , american became the first airline  to receive fair pay workplace’s  inaugural  pay equity certification, which is based on  a company’s identification and remediation  of pay equity issues. a part of syndio, this  seattle-based organization is working to  dismantle pay disparities based on gender,  race and ethnicity to create sustained fair pay.  strengthening our supplier diversity efforts alongside our work to build a diverse workforce, american is  committed to developing a more inclusive and diverse supplier  base. in  , we strengthened our supplier diversity program  with improvements to our reporting and data infrastructure.  having access to better data makes it easier to track our  progress. our company partnered with supplier.io, a leading  data, analytics and software resource for supplier diversity  programs, and we launched an initiative to provide division- level supplier diversity data to american leaders at every level  of the organization. as the airline industry rebounded, american increased the  percentage of diverse supplier spend in every category  year over year. our total spend with tier   diverse suppliers  increased by  % over  , the second consecutive year american airlines has increased our total spend with diverse  suppliers. our supplier diversity team is also actively engaged  with various organizations working to facilitate sourcing  from qualified, diverse-owned businesses. for example,  team members serve on the boards of directors, as well as  on the certification committees, of the regional councils of  the national minority supplier development council and the  women’s business enterprise national council. partnering with diverse entrepreneurs american is proud to partner with and support diverse  entrepreneurs across the united states. one example is silver  spoon desserts, a chicago-based black woman-owned  company founded by tamara turner. the company’s cakes  have elevated inflight dessert catering for our domestic premium customers. furthermore, the partnership with  american has enabled turner to grow her business and create  new job opportunities in her community.  in addition, as part of a $  million joint investment from  american airlines and british airways,   unique minority- owned and women-owned businesses were awarded contracts  to support the renovation of terminal   at new york’s john  f. kennedy international airport. the total amount of the  contracts exceeds the port authority of new york and new  jersey’s goal for diverse supplier awards. american and  british airways were also proud to award contracts to local  businesses in new york’s borough of queens. the two airlines  welcomed customers to the renovated terminal on dec.  ,  ,  marking the completion of the first phase.   american airlines sustainability report  climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message team members

u.s.  companies in any industry to be certified. the rules and  standards for certification  are available to the public. among the certification requirements, american will undergo  regular check-ins that involve a seven-point review of our  remediation plan. we have also pledged not to ask job  candidates about their prior compensation or expectations for  starting pay, which fair pay workplace has identified as one  of the largest sources of pay gaps.  recruitment recruiting the best talent for all roles across american is  critical to our ongoing success. two areas of particular focus  are pilots and aviation maintenance professionals. in both, we  will need to replace a large number of team members over the  next several years due largely to a wave of retirements. developing a pipeline to the flight deck american hired more than  ,  pilots in   and expects  to recruit more than  ,  in  . the need for pilots has also presented us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity to  expand awareness of and access to careers in aviation. we  made progress on this front in  :  % of pilots hired were  women,  % self-identified as black and  % identified as  people of color. at the   women in aviation international  conference in march, american extended   pilot job offers,  and we were the only mainline carrier to extend offers. we must develop a strong pipeline of pilot candidates, and  doing so requires a long-term outlook and commitment. the  american airlines cadet academy is one of the initiatives  that will help us achieve this goal. the cadet academy strives achieving recognition for our dei accomplishments a number of leading organizations and publications that  monitor dei performance have recognized american for our  work in this area. american is the only airline to receive a  perfect score on the human rights campaign foundation’s  corporate equality index every year since the award’s  inception in  . and in  , we were named a noteworthy  company for diversity by diversityinc for the second time. in  addition, we were honored to have the dallas business journal   recognize american’s chief diversity officer with a leader in  diversity award in  .  our dei efforts have also received the highest scores from the  disability equality index  and high scores from the seramount  inclusion index . our ebrgs were recognized in the following ways in   for  their work within american and for their efforts externally to  support our communities: • american finished second as a faith-friendly company in  the corporate religious equity, diversity & inclusion (redi)  index , based in part on the number and variety of our  religion-affiliated ebrgs. the redi index was created by  the religious freedom & business foundation. • our latin diversity network ebrg was ranked among the  top   ergs by latina style magazine , which is dedicated to  the concerns of the contemporary latina professional and  the latina business owner in the united states. • american’s black professional network ebrg won a spot in  the global erg network  list of the top   ergs.identifying pay gaps the chart below shows american’s controlled pay  gap for gender

students are expected to take approximately  three years to complete the program and become airline- ready professional pilots. they are then guaranteed an  interview with one of american’s wholly-owned regional  carriers: envoy air, psa airlines or piedmont airlines. over    cadets have entered the cadet academy since its launch  in  , and more than   now fly for one of these three. since  american has contractual flow-through agreements with each of our regional carriers, pilots who are hired by one of  them have the opportunity to be hired by american’s mainline  carrier based on its hiring needs. in fact, four cadet academy  graduates — all of them women — completed this path in    and joined american as first officers.  the number of cadet academy pilots hired thus far would likely  have been higher, but the pandemic delayed graduation for  some students. for example, it took cadets longer to accumulate  the required  ,  hours of flight time due to reduced flight  opportunities in   and  . we expect the number of cadet  academy pilots we hire to increase in the future.with the addition of tulsa-based spartan college of  aeronautics and technology in october  , the cadet  academy now offers five locations where students can  complete the program. other locations include cae in  phoenix and coast flight training in san diego, dallas,  and san marcos, texas. regardless of where students are  enrolled, each is paired with an american airlines pilot  mentor to guide them through their journey. women and people of color constitute  % of the students  who have entered the cadet academy since its launch in  .  women alone account for  %, and  % of students identify as  building partnerships to recruit   diverse talent we have expanded our recruitment efforts with the goal  of attracting the best diverse talent for all roles. for  example, american belongs to the hbcu partnership  challenge to promote greater engagement and support  between private

pilot training. our commitment totals $   million over the next decade. providing career opportunities in aviation maintenance  american currently employs more than  ,  aviation  maintenance professionals across our hubs and other  locations, and they play a critical role in ensuring the safety of every customer and team member aboard our aircraft.  the partnership we announced in october   with the  aviation institute of maintenance (aim)  will help us replenish  their ranks and provide students with a direct career path to  american. these are well-paying jobs with opportunities for  advancement, and they do not require an advanced degree. aim is the largest aviation maintenance training organization  in the united states, with   federal aviation administration- certificated aviation maintenance schools around the  country. approximately  ,  students are currently pursuing  certifications to become aircraft mechanics in aim’s  -month  program. as part of our agreement, american will guarantee  interviews for top candidates from aim’s chicago campus.  we will also provide students with opportunities to engage  with aircraft maintenance teams at our facilities across the  country. eligible students will be offered financial assistance  for certification exams as well as a complete set of tools  to start their careers off on the right foot. for american  team members who are interested in becoming aviation  maintenance professionals, aim will offer reduced tuition  rates and waive its application fee at any of its campuses. talent development training and development are vital to giving our team members  the tools and resources they need to do their best. our annual  performance appraisal process aligns team member goals  with the company’s objectives relating to operational reliability,  profitability and accountability. it also identifies areas of  development for the individual and provides connections to the  company’s broad range of training programs, which provide  opportunities for career growth. american spent about $   million on functional and professional development training in   , roughly $ ,  per person.working with obap to expand access to  careers in aviation  american donated $ .  million in   to the organization  of black aerospace professionals (obap). founded in   , this nonprofit is dedicated to the encouragement and  advancement of minorities in all aviation and aerospace  careers. american’s donation includes a $ ,  grant  to obap’s luke weathers jr. flight academy in olive  branch, mississippi, while the rest will be used to fund  scholarships for the flight school’s students. at obap's   th annual conference in august  , american  extended   job offers to pilots, making us the only  mainline carrier to offer employment to attendees. we also hosted more than   students at our facilities  throughout the summer as a part of obap’s aerospace  career education (ace) academy. the ace academy  provides

members with scholarships of up to $ ,   to attend a two-year, four-year or trade school, with an  additional $ ,  scholarship for first-generation students. human rights although we believe that governments are primarily  responsible for safeguarding human rights, we endeavor  to conduct our business in a socially responsible and  ethical manner consistent with human rights principles. our approach to human rights is guided by international  standards, and we respect and support the following: • united nations (u.n.) guiding principles on business   and human rights  • organisation for economic co-operation and  development’s guidelines for multinational enterprises • core conventions of the international labour  organization (ilo)  • ilo’s declaration on fundamental principles and   rights at work • u.n. universal declaration of human rights the american airlines human rights statement  applies  to all team members and contractors, employees of our  wholly-owned carriers, and our suppliers and other business  relationships. we continually evaluate our operations and  value chain to identify, assess and address human rights risks  and to engage key stakeholders. this evaluation is carried out  as part of american’s overall assessment process of critical  and significant suppliers for sustainability risks, as outlined in  our procurement policy. our statement complements our annual team member  training on the standards of business conduct. we also  provide a dedicated  /  hotline for team members, suppliers  and partners to report human rights concerns anonymously.  american does not tolerate any retribution or retaliation taken  against any individual who has, in good faith, sought advice or  reported questionable behavior or a possible violation. respecting freedom of association  as outlined in our human rights statement, american  respects freedom of association and our team members’  right to join, or not join, third-party organizations such as    american airlines sustainability report  climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message team members indexes & data customers labor unions or other lawful organizations of their own  selection, and we do not interfere with these organizations.  we also respect the right to bargain or not bargain  collectively, in accordance with local laws, without fear   of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. as of the end of    ,  % of our workforce was covered by collective  bargaining agreements. human trafficking prevention we believe american has become an industry leader in  combating human trafficking and child exploitation. we have  mandatory human trafficking awareness training for our frontline,  customer-facing team members — including flight attendants,  pilots and airport customer service representatives — as well as  for team members with international purchasing responsibilities.  this training is required for new hires and as part of our recurrent  training programs. we know that vigilance is key in fighting the  scourge of human trafficking, and we stand ready to help. we  also regularly update our reporting and security processes  with the latest information and best practices. american’s collaboration with government agencies, industry  partners and nongovernmental organizations is a key part of  our human trafficking prevention program. we work with a  range of partners, including the following:  • the u.s. department of homeland security (dhs) blue  campaign , a national public awareness effort that aims  to educate the public, law enforcement and industry  partners to recognize the indicators of human trafficking.  in early  , american spearheaded airportwide training  with dhs at ronald reagan washington national airport.  more than   people participated in this session,  including american team members, employees of other airlines, the transportation security administration and  the metropolitan washington airports authority, as well  as vendors. we expect to schedule additional training   at other hubs.  • new friends new life (nfnl) , a dallas-based  organization working to restore and empower formerly  trafficked teenage girls and sexually exploited women  and their children. according to nfnl research, texas  ranks second in the country for trafficking prevalence,  with more than  ,  victims annually statewide. by  providing access to education, job training, financial  assistance and mental health support, nfnl helps  women and their children overcome backgrounds of  abuse, addiction, poverty and limited opportunities. in  collaboration with three of our ebrgs — professional  women in aviation, black professional network and  latin diversity network — american has hosted a  human trafficking awareness presentation by nfnl for  the past four years at our fort worth headquarters. in   , the event was attended by   team members. • texas businesses against trafficking , a public-private  awareness and prevention initiative led by the texas  secretary of state. our legal team oversees the company’s compliance with  applicable domestic and international modern slavery and  human trafficking laws. in june  , we published the  annual update of american’s modern slavery and human  trafficking statement  to comply with the u.k. modern  slavery act of   and australia’s modern slavery act of   . american is also a signatory to the pact tourism  child-protection code of conduct , a voluntary set of  business principles to prevent child sex tourism and the  trafficking of children. for detailed team member diversity data,   see page  . for board diversity data, see  page   of our   proxy statement . indexes & data team members climate change safety sustainability  strategy ceo message  customers we rigorously measure and track customer satisfaction  through passenger surveys, using the results to implement  improvements across our operations.  of course, dependability and reliability are the foundation  for meeting customer needs. our chief priority remains the  same — getting customers to their destinations safely, on  schedule and with their baggage in tow, and we closely track  our performance on these metrics. our airline also places a  high value on fairness and accuracy in our communications,  and we go to great lengths to implement cybersecurity  measures and protect our customers’ privacy. working to improve operations as air travel approaches  pre-pandemic levels in  , american transported more than   million  passengers, a  % increase over the previous year. despite  this growth, our   completion factor — the percentage  of flights that weren’t canceled — fell by less than one  percentage point to  . %.  on-time performance for the year dipped by just over four  percentage points to  . %. this was due largely to the rapid  and significant expansion of our operations over the summer  amid challenging weather conditions, especially around some of our major hub airports in the south and on the east  coast. thanks to resilient planning and the integration of  new technologies, we were able to improve our performance  through the end of the year. the fourth quarter saw significant  improvements in completion factor and on time arrivals  despite significant impacts from winter storm elliott, when  weather cancellations rose significantly. american recovered  quickly from the storm and outperformed other carriers on  completion factor, and we were able to achieve the best  december holiday performance in the industry. we are constantly developing and evaluating new  technologies with the potential to improve our operations.  among those rolled out in  , the hub efficiency analytics  tool (heat) helps reduce cancellations in the face of major  weather events and other extraordinary situations. heat  uses real-time and historical data to help american’s hub  operations manage through and recover faster from such  events. it evaluates load factors, connections, crew legalities  and gate availability to adjust departure and arrival times on  hundreds of flights in a coordinated way. we deployed heat    times during the past year, preventing more than    cancellations at dallas fort worth international airport (dfw)  and charlotte douglas international airport (clt) alone.serving our customers american airlines is committed to providing our customers with a world-class travel  experience. flying to more than   destinations in the united states and internationally,  we continually look for ways to improve and lead our industry by strengthening  operational performance and enhancing service offerings.    american airlines sustainability report   ceo message sustainability  strategy climate change safety team members indexes & data   customers  our smart gating technology, which we introduced at major  hubs in  , is also leading to greater efficiencies. by routing  aircraft to available gates more quickly, this tool can provide  customers with more time to make connecting flights. in   , it reduced taxi times by a total of more than   hours  per day at dfw, clt and miami international airport. smart  gating is yielding important environmental benefits as well,  which you can read about on page  . enhancing the customer experience   on the ground and in flight we work hard to provide exceptional service. in  ,  american continued to offer resources that help customers  travel with confidence. through our ongoing verifly  partnership, we help passengers understand and verify their  requirements for international travel. verifly’s mobile health  wallet makes it easy for passengers to upload the forms they  need to get verified status for travel. our customers who  use verifly can also use our mobile app and aa.com to get  mobile boarding passes and take advantage of dedicated and  expedited check-in lanes at several airports.  customers traveling internationally can access our ready to  fly hub when viewing their eligible reservations on aa.com or  through the american airlines mobile app. its checklist outlines  everything they need for travel. in  , we made enhancements to the american airlines  app, giving customers the flexibility to pay for products and  services while using its chat function. team members also use  mobile devices around the gate to scan boarding passes and  gate-check bags or provide other support for customers with  children or mobility issues. this helped improve the customer  experience by making navigating the airport more convenient  for our passengers. in  , our customer service efforts were recognized for the fifth consecutive year by the apex official  airline ratings — global airline category. american received  a prestigious five star rating based on verified customer  feedback on the overall travel experience. among our inflight improvements in  , we completed an  ongoing project that expanded overhead bin capacity by  %  on the airbus   and  % on the boeing  . customers  appreciate having more space for carry-on luggage, and  the percentage of our fleet with expanded bin capacity will  continue to grow as we take deliveries of new aircraft. american has high-speed wi-fi on more mainline aircraft  than any other carrier. our free inflight entertainment gives  customers traveling on our domestic narrowbody aircraft  access to innovative, exclusive and diverse content directly on  their personal devices at no cost. that includes some of the  most anticipated live events in football and soccer annually  as well as news networks. in  , we added offerings that  promote wellness on the go. among them, obé fitness features  a variety of classes that offer soothing in-seat stretches, simple  twists, healthy-eating hacks, relaxing breathwork and more. in march  , american became the first u.s. airline to  guarantee family seating. we now seat children   and  under adjacent to an accompanying adult at no additional  cost, assuming they meet certain conditions outlined in our  customer service plan . posting record customer satisfaction scores based on a sampling of approximately   million customer  surveys, american’s likelihood to recommend (ltr) score  rose to a company-best  .  for  . that represents a  gain of  .

members and nonmembers.  we share feedback with our customer service and food  service teams as well as our airport teams to identify areas  for improvement. for example, in the new terminal b at  laguardia airport (lga) in new york city, we learned from  survey results that frequent travelers were dissatisfied  because the tsa precheck location was too far from  american’s check-in and bag drop area. working together  with lga leadership, we convinced tsa to move the  security checkpoint to a new, dedicated area. we took a  similar approach for customers without tsa precheck and  positioned the check-in and bag drop area so that it is directly  in front of the main entry for their security checkpoint.  american is currently establishing a partner survey process  across the   member airlines of the oneworld® alliance,  including our west coast international alliance with alaska  airlines. we expect the survey to launch in  . emphasizing fairness and accuracy in our  communications we are in business to provide safe, dependable and friendly  air transportation to our customers, and we work hard to  make their experience a positive one. at the same time,  averaging  ,  scheduled departures per day is challenging  and complex. inevitably, some of our flights are affected by  adverse circumstances — some within our control and others  not. when that happens, our customer service plan outlines  the many policies and processes we have put in place to ensure that american’s customers are treated fairly and  receive the assistance they need.  american is also committed to accuracy in our communications  and marketing. to help customers make informed decisions,  we provide information about the benefits of flying with  american and strive to represent fairly the social or environ- mental benefits of our activities. we endeavor not to mislead  vulnerable market segments, such as children, about our  services. moreover, we do not publish or otherwise share  information about our competitors or other companies that   is knowingly false or could discredit them. responding swiftly to customer concerns  the ability to respond swiftly to any customer concerns is a  critical part of our approach to customer satisfaction. during peak times, when our response may not be as rapid as we  would like, we have tools in place such as chat through the  mobile app, automated callback and immediate, automated  correspondence to update customers with the most relevant  information for their travels. we also share reports of  customer concerns quarterly with senior executives and our  board of directors. our customer experience leadership team  receives information about customer correspondence daily.  american is especially focused on comments that allege  discriminatory behavior, and we have empowered a special  customer relations team to increase awareness of such  complaints among customer-facing team members. each  allegation is investigated, and disciplinary action — up to  and including termination — can result if we determine that  unacceptable behavior occurred.    american airlines sustainability report   ceo message sustainability  strategy climate change safety team members indexes & data   customers meeting the needs of diverse customers american’s approach to customer engagement reflects our  commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. we continue  to rely on the guidance of the community council we  formed in   to provide objective and candid insights on  company initiatives, particularly those focused on improving  the customer travel experience and meeting the needs of  underrepresented customer groups. in  , we launched our “no limits” ad campaign to help us  authentically and meaningfully connect with black travelers.  created by walton isaacson, our multicultural agency of  record, the campaign runs primarily on minority-owned media  platforms to ensure that we reach our intended audience. in  addition, through our james beard foundation sponsorship,  american features menu items from diverse chefs in our  flagship lounges and flagship first dining locations. we implement procedures across our operations with the  goal of treating all customers equitably. for example, to  help remove potential bias during the boarding process, we  updated our standby and upgrade list process to clear all  requests automatically if seats are available. prioritizing cybersecurity and data privacy cybersecurity and data privacy are key priorities at american  airlines. in  , we published a new cybersecurity policy  statement , and we updated our privacy policy  in march  . american’s approach to identifying and mitigating  cybersecurity risk is aligned with the national institute of  standards and technology cybersecurity framework. the  program, which includes policies, standards and a variety of technical security solutions to prevent and respond to  cybersecurity issues, is evaluated annually by a global  cybersecurity firm.  the chief information security officer is responsible  for cybersecurity and reports to the chief digital and  information officer, who is a member of our senior  management team. our board of directors oversees   our work on cybersecurity, with the audit committee  regularly reviewing cyber and data privacy risks and  receiving briefings from senior leaders on these matters   at least quarterly.  our company also has a formal cybersecurity training and  awareness program focused on educating our team members  about cybersecurity risk and our internal policies and  procedures related to cybersecurity, privacy and compliance.  certain trainings — such as basic data security awareness  — are conducted annually, and all team members and  contractors are expected to complete it. a number of team members undergo additional  cybersecurity and data privacy training depending on their  roles and responsibilities. we also review the cybersecurity  profile of suppliers as part of our risk management strategy  and engage certain suppliers on their practices.  american’s privacy program, which is audited annually, is led  by our chief privacy and data protection officer and staffed  with certified privacy professionals. we also have a privacy  council composed of more than   senior leaders who meet  quarterly to discuss privacy issues, challenges and proposed  solutions. the council is supported by approximately    privacy liaisons across the business. the privacy program is guided by key privacy principles that  inform how american handles and protects the personal  information in our care, such as responsibility, transparency,  security and choice. our privacy office regularly conducts  privacy impact assessments of business processes and  supporting information technology (it) systems that process  personal data. the primary role of these assessments is to  identify and remediate associated privacy risks.  information obtained from privacy impact assessments is  used to populate our personal data inventory, which details  what personal data our company stores, how it is used,  where it is stored, with whom it is shared and for how long  it is retained. we supplement these efforts by coordinating  with our it department to incorporate privacy design  requirements into the architecture and operation of our  systems that store and process personal data. we also use  these processes to fulfill our legal requirements for handling  data rights requests and data disclosures via our internal  and external privacy policies and statements. our team members take privacy training courses annually,  and the privacy office conducts individual training sessions  with different business units each year that address a  variety of privacy issues. we also coordinate closely with our  vendor management and corporate legal functions, which  provide input on privacy terms and provisions in agreements  with our business partners and vendors to ensure that  privacy issues are appropriately addressed. contractors  are required to take a course on global data privacy and  protection annually or as they sign on. for operational performance data,   see page  .   american airlines sustainability report   ceo message sustainability  strategy climate change safety team

to express an opinion on the ghg examination subject matter based on  our examination, and to express a conclusion on the ghg review subject matter based on our review. our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the american institute  of certified public accountants in at -c section  , concepts common to all attestation engagements , and  at-c section  , examination engagements . those standards require that we plan and perform the  examination to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ghg examination subject matter is in  accordance with the criteria , in all material respects. an examination involves performing procedures to obtain  evidence about the ghg examination subject matter. the nature, timing, and extent of the procedures  selected depend on our judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the ghg  examination subject matter, w hether due to fraud or error. we believe that the evidence we obtained is  sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the american institute of

to  obtain limited assurance about whether any material mo difications should be made to the ghg review subject  matter in order for it to be in accordance with the criteria . the procedures performed in a review vary in nature  and timing from and are substantially less in extent than an examination, the objective o f which is to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the ghg review subject matter is in accordance with the criteria , in all  material respects, in order to express an opinion. accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. because of  the limited natur e of the engagement, the level of assurance obtained in a review is substantially lower than the  assurance that would have been obtained had an examination been performed. we believe that the review  evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to pro vide a reasonable basis for our conclusion. we are required to be independent and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant  ethical requirements related to the engagement. the procedures we performed in our review were based on our professional judgment and consisted primarily  of inquiries of management to obtain an understanding of the methodology and inputs used in deriving the  ghg review subject matter, recalculating a selection of the ghg review subject matter based on the  methodology and inputs identified by management, and performing analytical procedures over the ghg  review subject matter .  our examination was limited to the ghg examination subject matter presented in the ghg statement and our  review was limited to the ghg review subject matter presented in the ghg statement. the report includes  other information, metrics, and prospective information that were not subject to our examination or review  procedures. accordingly, we do not express an opinion, conclusion, or any o ther form of assurance on such  information, the assumptions and achievability of prospective information, or metrics in the report . as described in note  of the ghg statement, emissions data are subject to measurement uncertainties  resulting from limitati ons inherent in the nature and methods of determining such data. obtaining sufficient  appropriate examination evidence to support our opinion and sufficient appropriate review evidence to support  our conclusion does not reduce the inherent uncertainty in t he data. the selection by management of different  but acceptable measurement techniques could have resulted in materially different measurements. in our opinion, the ghg examination subject matter is in accordance with the criteria , in all material respect s. based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the ghg review  subject matter in order for it to be in accordance with the criteria . dallas, texas july ,    kpmg   american airlines sustainability report  indexes & data  customers team members climate change

as of dec.  ,  , american has not had any structural or material methodology changes that warrant  recalculating its scope  , scope  , or scope   base year emissions. american’s ghg emissions fluctuate over time primarily due to the use of jet fuel in operations. as a result  of the covid-  pandemic, our operations were significantly impacted such that our fuel consumption and  associated emissions in   and   were lower than historical levels. as american’s operations have  returned to near pre-pandemic levels in  , associated emissions have also increased.  . measurement methodologies
