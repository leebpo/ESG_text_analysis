table of contents travel can change the world. for good.  introduction  in  , delta soared out of the pandemic era  and into stabilization and recovery. we returned  to the skies and found that, once again, the world  is a better place thanks to the miracle of safe,  efficient and comfortable air travel that connects  people and communities worldwide. all of this is possible thanks to the dedication,  passion and hard work of the  , + people of  delta air lines. because of their efforts, delta was  the most awarded airline in the country in  ,  earning recognition from fortune as the world’s  most admired airline for the  th year; being  honored as the most reliable airline by the wall  street journal; and being awarded for outstanding  customer service and innovation by the points  guy, popular science, the beat and more. as we look ahead,   is a year in which we  continue to transform travel with bold new  initiatives like free in-flight wi-fi and delta sync,  a platform to further enhance and personalize  the travel experience at all points of the journey.  amid our progress, we will always stay true to  our people-oriented values that drive everything we do. to that end, we will continue to focus   on the following: making safety our no.   priority, always safety is in our dna. in  , we continued to  put our safety culture front and center as we  onboarded thousands of new delta employees.  our long-standing commitment to our “just  culture” initiative instills in new employees the  mindset that every mistake is an opportunity  to learn and that transparency without fear or  punishment is essential to keeping our people and  customers safe. just culture uses collaboration,  observation and conversations to review and  investigate safety issues and prevent them in the  future – teaching by showing, not telling. the program is one of many tools we utilize daily  to ensure that safety always comes first. powered by people and culture our people have always been at the heart of our  success, which is why investing in them was  a primary focus of  . despite the lingering  financial challenges of the pandemic, we recognized our people’s excellence with a special  profit-sharing payment totaling $  million in  february  . three months later, we announced  a  % pay increase for eligible employees  worldwide. finally, in february  , we were  happy to pay $  million in   profit-sharing  checks to our employees. delta’s commitment to our employees’ financial  well-being isn’t solely about pay – it’s about the  ability to manage personal finances and save  for emergencies as well as retirement. research  shows that one-third of u.s. households cannot  come up with $  cash to cover an emergency  expense. to address this problem, we developed  a program in partnership with operation hope  and fidelity investments to give every delta  employee access to a $ ,  emergency savings  account and an online financial education and  coaching program. in addition, we continue to  offer our leading  (k) program in which over   % of our employees participated in  ,  featuring a  % automatic contribution with  another  % company match.a message from ed bastian ed bastian   ceo delta air lines introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix  building a more equitable world delta is committed to pushing toward a more  just and equitable world for all. that includes  a commitment to improving the diversity of  our people at all levels of the company, with  measurable goals and transparency that we  outline in our annual “close the gap” report.  while we still have a long journey ahead, we  are heartened to report that delta increased the  representation of women, black talent and other  underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in  roles across the company in  . additionally, delta accelerated an essential  partnership with oneten, an organization  that aims to hire, promote and advance one  million black individuals into family-sustaining  careers over ten years. our intentional skills- first approach to identifying talent removes  unnecessary barriers to higher-earning jobs  and careers, such as eliminating four-year  college degree requirements for most roles  and establishing a skills-first apprenticeship  program and occupation-specific academies –  like our propel program for pilot talent.flying toward a sustainable future in  , focus on climate and the environment  took on a larger role within delta as we expanded  our leadership oversight to cement sustainability  as a core business imperative. we promoted  peter carter to executive vice president of  external affairs, expanding his role leading delta’s  legal, regulatory and government affairs functions  to also oversee the airline’s international,  innovation and sustainability strategy. we also  welcomed chief sustainability officer, pam  fletcher, to lead our journey to net-zero emissions  by  , focusing on short-, medium- and long- term initiatives. in the short term, the delta  team is having an immediate impact by reducing  single-use plastic consumption on board,  electrifying our ground operations and integrating  a sustainable mindset across our supply chain.  we are building partnerships now to help create  an economically viable market for sustainable  aviation fuel in the years ahead as innovation   and technology expand the nascent industry. our fleet continues to improve its efficiency,  and last year we ordered   boeing  -   aircraft that will be  –  % more fuel efficient  than the planes they will replace. delta’s  carbon council, which scours our operation   for improvements to fuel efficiency, saved over    million gallons last year thanks to enhanced winglet installations for drag reduction, weight  reduction initiatives and flight routing and  speed optimizations. and we’re investing now in technology that  carries the potential to have a significant impact  over the long term, such as our partnership  with joby aviation, which will revolutionize the  customer journey by offering sustainable home- to-airport travel utilizing electric vertical takeoff  and landing aircraft. serving our communities delta has long been committed to the  communities where we live, work and serve.  we focus our giving on the environment, equity,  education and wellness while supporting  our armed forces and veterans and anti- human trafficking programs, partnering with  organizations like american red cross, captain  planet, junior achievement and uncf, among  others. as we return to profitability, we continue  our commitment to contributing  % of the  company’s profits to communities worldwide.  while funding nonprofit partners is critical, the  thousands of delta people who step up and  volunteer every year drive our spirit of service.  in  , their work included assembling nearly   ,  bikes for marine toys for tots at delta  techops, volunteering to provide meals at hosea helps on martin luther king jr. day to  celebrate his life and work and donating  ,   units of life-saving blood to the american red  cross, making delta its no.   corporate blood  drive sponsor for  . that dedication is  why delta was again recognized on the civic    as one of the   most community-minded  companies in the u.s. last year by points of  light, the world’s largest organization dedicated  to volunteer service. we are excited about the years ahead and  humbled by the experiences of the global  pandemic. as we return to the skies, the  lessons of recent years will always remain  with us – a reminder of the power of human  connection and the clarity that helps us  embrace what is really important in our lives. i welcome all our customers, employees,  investors and community partners to join us   on this ongoing journey. ed bastian  chief executive officer  delta air lines, inc. introduction safety

appendix  safety  safety is our number one  priority. as an airline,  health, safety and security  are non-negotiable and  operating a safe and reliable  airline is the underpinning  of our success. we are  grateful and privileged that  our customers, colleagues  and communities entrust  us with their transportation  needs. safety for our  employees and customers is  a foundational commitment  that permeates our culture.in conjunction with our organization-wide safety  policy, we designed the sms to be proactive,  predictive and data-driven in nature. delta  was an early adopter of sms principles, and in   , we were one of the first airlines to receive  validation from the faa several months before  the requirement to do so. as our sms accountable executive (ae), delta’s  ceo retains ultimate responsibility for the  sms and has final authority for delta’s safety  performance. the ae and delta leadership  committee (dlc) are committed to providing  the necessary resources to ensure our sms  remains healthy and effective. they are briefed  regularly on our safety performance.  for the sms to remain effective, we rely on  continuous, open reporting from our employees.  we investigate all safety reports fairly and fully.  we will not take disciplinary action against an  employee for reporting safety hazards, concerns safety management system delta’s safety management system (sms) is a leader-driven, process-oriented approach   to ensuring occupational and operational safety through identifying hazards, assessing and  mitigating risk, monitoring our safety performance and promoting a positive safety culture.   we apply safety risk management (srm) to  identify hazards that could lead to an accident  or incident. for example: implementation of new systems,   such as a new aircraft type  revision of existing systems,   such as procedural or manual changes development of new procedures, such   as adding new airports to our network identification of new hazards or   ineffective risk controls through   our safety assurance processesor incidents, including when an error occurs  while the employee acts in good faith. delta  is committed to a positive, just safety culture  where every employee is empowered to stop the  operation at any time to address safety concerns  impacting our customers, people or equipment.leadership policy

customers and  a safe workplace for employees. we proudly transported more than    million customers safely in  . our ability to serve our large customer  base is only possible with the reliability demonstrated daily through the  unwavering commitment of our flight attendants, pilots, maintenance  technicians and ground agents. it is critical for delta and the broader airline industry to utilize all the  tools available to mitigate in-flight misconduct and maintain safe flight  experiences for our customers. delta maintains a zero-tolerance policy  toward workplace violence. we provide de-escalation and self-defense  training for flight attendants and other frontline employees and continue  to partner with law enforcement to increase security at dozens of airports  to protect our passengers and employees. we will continue collaborating  industry-wide on solutions, including maintaining a no-fly list and  cooperating with local, state and federal authorities on the prosecution   of disruptive passengers. additional information can be found on our website   at the-way-we-fly.pdf (delta.com)safety and security safety is fundamental to connecting our global  workforce with our

to pick up, cleanliness remains a fundamental element of delta brand expectations.  we are committed to delivering a world-class customer experience through the delta carestandardsm,  our science-backed approach to health and safety. global cleanliness supports the delta brand promise,  as we move forward on our commitment to clean travel experiences.  employee safety the safety of our employees in delivering operations  is an enterprise-wide responsibility and is deeply  embedded in our culture.  we empower our employees to slow down or stop any operation if they  feel it is necessary to maintain a safe work environment for our personnel  and a safe travel experience for our customers. we operate several cross- divisional and division-specific employee safety programs that help to  achieve our safety objectives. these programs are critical to preventing  serious injuries by proactively approaching and encouraging safety dialogue  across the company. we have regular safety time-out reminders and  exercises across our entire operation. in  , delta hired a record number of new full-time employees, approximately   , , to support the rising demand for post-pandemic travel. to successfully  integrate this significant influx of new employees, investments were made to  adapt and improve our many safety training and management programs and to  account for the rise in travel demand.  ythe delta carestandard sm organizes a team of  clean ambassadors dedicated to overseeing  consistent cleaning quality by delta employees,  cabin service cleaners and janitorial partners.  ydelta partners with lysol® pro solutions and the  purell® brand to implement science-backed  cleaning technologies and protocols designed  to ensure surfaces have been disinfected using  methods approved by trusted experts.  ydelta continues to use air filtration systems on  jet bridges and focuses on air quality onboard  through continuous filtering and refreshing  cabin air.our clean ambassadors domestically serve    airports as cleanliness champions. these  champions support cleaning team members across  our areas and aircraft, ensuring we follow end-to- end cleanliness protocols and provide customers  with a first-class delta experience. we use trusted  partnerships and a commitment to continuous  improvement to prioritize health and wellness.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix safety programs delta provides a suite of safety  training that includes compliance  requirements as well as tailored  information relevant to an  employee’s role:   regular quality assurance audits  and employee interviews are  performed at domestic and  international airports to evaluate  the implementation and success  of these initiatives and programs.  the audit findings and interview  results are shared with leaders to  proactively identify opportunity  areas and best practices. just culture – one of our long-established safety initiatives  – is at the forefront to emphasize its importance to new  employees within delta. just culture uses collaboration,  observations and conversations, such as peer-to-peer or  manager-to-employee, to investigate safety incidents and to  prevent them in the future, teaching by showing rather than  by telling. just culture is a mindset that focuses on learning  from good faith mistakes rather than punishment or blaming.  safety culture – in late  , we completed safety culture  assessments at three of our larger u.s. airports – lax, slc  and den. the results were validated by an external airport  leadership team. following the validation, grassroots  teams representing frontline and mid-level leadership  employees were established to address challenges  identified in the assessment. projects addressed “cultural norms” with teams applying  simple culture-based tools to develop an understanding of  the beliefs, perceptions and assumptions that support those  norms. during  , this approach was used for projects  such as safety time-outs, vehicle use and care, leaders  setting the tone for safety, ergonomic behaviors and team lifts and sharing safety concerns and mistakes. having those  individuals closest to the work drive change in their areas and  engage with peers in the development of solutions created  shared success.  the ground safety advocate (gsa) program launched,  bringing to life the just culture concept by assisting new  employees in practicing their peer-to-peer communication  skills about safety concerns to promote best safety practices.  we expanded the network of health centrals (onsite health  and well-being centers within airports) to provide immediate  physical therapy, proactive treatments and exercise routines  and, in many cases, access to gym equipment.  investments in ground handling equipment were made,  such as powerstows (i.e., advanced belt loaders that  can transport bags inside aircraft cargo bins), and other  significant, continued investment in our eligible gse fleet,  including electrification. l  leading safety – a unified, cross-divisional learning  program for safety leaders – was launched to enhance  leadership skills and hear advice and lessons learned from  other leaders across the company.  a back-to-basics course in occupational safety and health  administration (osha) requirements and injury case  management is in place to better position frontline leadership  personnel to conduct more accurate, timely and complete  injury investigations.flight safety – we have made further enhancements to  our safety assurance process through proactive key safety  performance indicators directly related to the operation of  an aircraft. these precursors allow better insights within  an evolving environment and deliver risks to appropriate  stakeholders before they become larger concerns. delta held its first annual safety and environmental  summit in late  , bringing together the frontline safety  and environmental leaders across the company. this two-  day event included messages from delta’s divisional and  corporate leaders, keynote speakers and breakout sessions  to deliver more detailed information on specific topics. we communicated the importance of safety through weekly  videos, internal posts, town halls, daily interactions with  leaders and within workspaces to supplement training and  embed a culture of safety.  safety at a glance trir   (total recordable injury rate)  .  dart   (days away,

perspective.  our large divisions also support employee  involvement groups that focus on  everything from improving the customer  experience to enhancing work-life balance.  we regularly hold executive-led,  company-wide town hall discussions,  communicating our ongoing commitment  to our people and culture. in line with  our open-door policy, our in-person and  accessible online events with senior  management team members facilitate  communication across the company.our executive leaders and the board  of directors also hear employee voices  through the engagement of the delta  board council. this group comprises  employee representatives from every  major noncontract operating division,  providing a direct voice for employee  feedback, interests and perspectives. listening,

pathway for aviation companies to set  . °c-aligned targets and announced plans to  launch a formal update to target-setting guidance  for the aviation sector consistent with limiting  warming to  . °c. given the rapidly evolving  landscape, delta plans to monitor further sbti  guidance, working with our counterparts and a a  to align as an industry on a unified approach that  commits to ambitious targets, which will drive  meaningful change. our ability to achieve our ambitious climate  goals depends on a combination of science,  technology, innovation, government policy and  partnerships. achievement will require, among  other things, significant capital investment  (including from third parties), research and  development from manufacturers and other  stakeholders and progression of government  policies and incentives. these actions are critical  to reduce the cost and increase production  of saf and other technologies that are not  presently in existence or available at scale.    non-co e effects which may also contribute to aviation-induced warming are not included in this target. delta commits to report publicly on its collaboration with stakeholders to improve understanding   of opportunities to mitigate the non-co e impacts of aviation annually over its target timeframe.   carbon emissions intensity was materially impacted in   and   by lower passenger loads and other factors during the covid-  pandemic and delta’s middle seat blocking measures through april  ,  .climate and the environment we remain steadfast in our aspirations to address

goals by  , bolstered by our intention to invest $  billion through the end of  . we need technology enhancements to reach our  goal of net-zero emissions by  . to promote  progress, we launched the delta sustainable  skies lab, a first-of-its-kind airline innovation  lab to accelerate research, design and testing  for a more sustainable future of air travel. the  lab serves as a platform to advance internal  collaboration and innovative partnerships.  additionally, in the future, the lab will include an  engagement studio intended to showcase delta’s  evolving sustainability efforts in a single place. in this section, we provide a high-level overview  of our science-based targets, the key elements  of our anticipated decarbonization pathway, our  progress toward our existing goals and climate  risks and opportunities based on our climate  scenario analysis.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix the travel experience  we are accelerating our efforts to build a more  sustainable travel experience by reducing  single-use plastics on board, reducing food  waste and introducing sustainability in the  products and amenities we deliver to our  customers. we refreshed our onboard product  offerings in early  , and as a result of our  initial single-use plastic replacement strategy,  we reduced onboard single-use plastic  consumption by approximately  .  million  pounds per year. ground operations   and facilities as of december  , we electrified  %  of our eligible core and critical ground  equipment fleets necessary to service an  aircraft at the gate, such as baggage tractors,  belt loaders, aircraft tow tractors and other  eligible gse. we continue to work with airports  throughout our network to add additional  charging infrastructure to support our goal of  electrifying  % of our eligible gse fleet by   . additionally, we invested in updating  airport facilities, modernizing the customer  experience, and creating more sustainable  facilities by incorporating technology to   reduce our environmental impact. supply chain  in  , we onboarded over  % of our top     supply chain vendors, based on spend,   to the ecovadis esg ratings platform. ecovadis  scorecards allow us to measure the impact of  our supply chain, encourage vendors to take  action to improve their scores and identify  potential new vendors with strong   sustainability ratings.   our decarbonization  pathway to achieve net-zero by  , meaningful ghg  emissions intensity improvement by   and  our non-climate sustainability goals, we will need  to use all levers commercially and economically  available to us now and in the future. our path  focuses on two main pillars:  fleet our fleet renewal efforts have the most  significant impact on reducing emissions  and emissions intensity from our airline  operations. in  , we took delivery of    aircraft that were, on average,  % more fuel  efficient per seat mile than aircraft retired  since  , contributing to a fleet-wide fuel  efficiency improvement of  . % compared  to  . we also announced a series of new  aircraft purchase agreements. we expect  these purchase agreements to bolster our fleet  renewal plans and continue to improve fuel  efficiency in future periods.fuel sustainable aviation fuel (saf) is central to  reducing the life cycle emissions from aviation  fuel; however, it is not currently available at the  scale or cost necessary to meet the industry’s  needs. we have established a goal of replacing   % of our jet fuel consumption with saf by  the end of  . we expect this goal to require  at least   million gallons of saf annually. at  the end of  , delta had agreements in place  with multiple suppliers for an aggregate offtake  of   million gallons of saf annually by  .  these agreements are subject to third-party  investment and timely facility development.aircraft operations to further reduce our emissions intensity,  our carbon council, a cross-divisional senior  leadership team, is focused on executing  and tracking operational initiatives that  reduce jet fuel consumption. this work  includes immediate improvements within  flight operations and collaboration with  outside experts such as mit to evaluate  new technologies. delta’s efforts also  supplement industry-wide efforts to support  the modernization of the air traffic control  systems, allowing for increased fuel efficiency  and less carbon-intensive flying.eliminate our climate impact from flying: embed sustainability in everything we do:path to

expect progress toward our climate goals, particularly our  decarbonization efforts, to be driven by the following levers: fleet  renewal, sustainable aviation fuel and operational improvements.  technological innovation concerning these levers, stakeholder  engagement and coalition and policy development will be critical  to reaching our goals. we mention our cross-collaboration and  partnerships in this section, and our climate lobbying efforts are  detailed later in this report. the graphic model illustrates one potential pathway to achieve  net-zero by  . this pathway is a proposal subject to numerous  assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are outside our  control. as illustrated by these graphics, even with meaningful  improvements in fuel efficiency, our absolute emissions are  expected to grow for a period of time due to projected capacity  growth in future years. we aim to achieve absolute emission  reductions over the medium- to long-term as we

guiding our fleet strategy and capital allocation  decisions concerning our fleet. we plan to continue our fleet renewal initiative  to support our environmental sustainability  efforts. we expect fleet renewal to play a  significant role in progressing our climate goals.  in the short term, this means aiming for annual  improvements in fleet-wide fuel efficiency  each year through  , which, if achieved,  would represent a meaningful reduction in  fuel consumption rate from   to  .  following  , we envision the availability of  next-generation aircraft technology, such as  the deployment of

hydrocarbon fuel synthetically produced using renewable or waste-derived  feedstock. it will play a key role in aviation’s decarbonization pathway but is currently  unavailable at scale or price parity with conventional jet fuel. for the aviation industry to achieve net-zero by  , an  exponential increase to  –  billion gallons of saf per    year by   could be required.   critical building blocks for scaling saf include: government incentives:  performance-based, as well as feedstock- and technology- neutral incentives are required to help drive investment toward  the development of saf at a reasonable cost. for example, at the  federal level, a  -year saf-specific blenders tax credit coupled  with a dedicated grant program are some of the policy supports  necessary to help catalyze the domestic market. additionally,  at the state level, incentives and programs such as california’s  low carbon fuel standard’s voluntary opt-in program for saf  need to be more widely adopted to bring saf to other geographic  locations economically. as international governments seek to drive  investment in saf, we caution that mandates without incentives  will fail to ensure sufficient supply and reasonable pricing.what is sustainable aviation fuel? saf is an alternative jet fuel that achieves lower life cycle ghg emissions  compared to conventional jet fuel using various feedstocks such as used  cooking oil, cellulosic waste and municipal solid waste. approved conversion  processes produce saf, such as fischer-tropsch, hefa (hydroprocessed  esters and fatty acids) and co-processing. we do not procure or accept   saf made from palm oil or pfad (palm fatty acid distillate).  y in the context of the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for  international aviation (corsia), the international civil aviation  organization (icao) developed saf sustainability requirements that  include minimum emissions reductions, land use and food security  considerations, among other factors. saf must meet these requirements  to be eligible for compliance with corsia.  y icao has approved two entities, the international sustainability and  carbon certification (iscc) and roundtable of sustainable biomaterials  (rsb) to certify the sustainability of saf.saf accounting framework:  one of the benefits of saf is that it can be delivered and  stored as a “drop-in fuel” using existing pipelines and storage  infrastructure. however, an effective book-and-claim framework  will be necessary from a carbon accounting perspective because  saf comingles with conventional jet fuel. current feedstock and technologies can produce saf with up to   % lower life cycle emissions than conventional jet fuel, with the  ability to blend with conventional jet fuel at up to  %. delta aims to procure more than   million gallons of saf  annually in an effort to achieve a goal of  % saf utilization by  the end of  . in  , we signed offtake agreements with gevo  and dg fuels, bringing our procured   saf gallons to  m.  we continue to purchase from and align with leaders in the saf  industry to accelerate our yearly procurement. we have negotiated  offtake arrangements for future saf supply with these suppliers:     according to the air transport action group (atag), an independent coalition providing a platform for the commercial aviation sector to collaborate on long-term sustainability issues.gevo:   million gallons  annually produced by using  industrial field corn  aemetis:   million gallons  annually produced by utilizing  used cooking oil and tallow as  feedstock dg fuels:   million gallons  annually produced by using  timber waste nwab:   million gallons  annually produced by utilizing  slash, forest residues and mill  residues   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix life cycle emissions of fuel from well-to-wake life cycle emissions account for the ghg emissions at every stage of  the fuel’s life – from development and production to its ultimate use.  we have reported “tank-to-wake” combustion emissions since   as  part of our greenhouse gas emissions inventory. sustainable aviation  fuel emissions are reported on a full life cycle “well-to-wake” basis to  demonstrate the emissions reductions. beginning in  , and again in   , our ghg emissions data includes “well-to-wake” fuel emissions  to increase transparency and follow sbti guidance.  life cycle emissions from saf can currently be up to  % lower than  conventional jet fuel because the feedstock production either absorbs  carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or avoids generating ghg emissions  associated with the disposal and decomposition of the feedstock as  a waste. for bio-based feedstocks, the analysis also considers the  potential ghg emissions increases from indirect land use changes  (iluc) and life cycle assessment (lca). sustainable aviation fuel (continued) delivery of this fuel is subject to timely third-party investment and facility  development. these agreements expand availability of this nascent technology and  align with delta’s saf goal as a founding member of the first movers coalition.  . m gallons   of saf delivered  ,  mt   of co e avoided used primarily at   airports:   lax, sfo, cdg, lhr, amsin  , delta procured  .  million gallons of saf, a   % increase compared to  . delta is also working closely with customers to  increase demand for saf and help address the  significant price premiums. many of delta’s corporate  customers are motivated by the aggressive scope    targets they have set for their commercial business  travel and cargo emissions. in  , delta had  agreements with   corporate customers, travel  agencies and freight forwarders to help fund and apply  saf toward ghg emissions from their business travel  and cargo shipped on delta.  over the long term, a shift to next-generation saf, such  as power-to-liquid fuels and the ability to blend at more  than  % saf is necessary for long-term efficiencies.  achieving these saf goals will require working with  manufacturers and fuel providers on regulatory  approvals and significant investments in renewable  electricity. these fuels, coupled with the use of direct air  capture of carbon at the saf production facilities, have  the potential to achieve life cycle emissions reductions  beyond the  % maximum estimated today.gevo nwab aemetis dg fuels  goal  remaining current saf offtakemillion gallons    introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix aircraft operations carbon council’s   operational improvements as we work to execute and track  operational initiatives that reduce jet  fuel consumption and improve emissions  intensity, delta’s carbon council manages  fuel burn and drives reductions in fuel  consumption through cross-divisional  collaboration. our carbon council is  an established group of senior leaders  overseeing delta’s operational trajectory  to advance fuel efficiency and progress  toward our medium- and long-term  sustainability goals. strategic working groups support  our carbon council to drive further  improvement in fuel efficiency. the working  groups consist of relevant business units,  each chosen for focused collaboration on  specific initiatives. each working group  can spearhead progress in its dedicated  area while identifying and communicating  opportunities and roadblocks to the  executive leadership team.one example of the carbon council’s work  is the decision to install enhanced split- scimitar winglets for drag reduction on the    fleet. delta techops recently finished  a five-and-a-half-year project to equip all    delta  - er aircraft with these  winglets. this aerodynamic enhancement  improves fuel efficiency by reducing lift- induced drag. we expect this investment  to yield an annual fuel savings of   million  gallons for this fleet type alone, with an  incremental  .  million gallons of fuel  to be saved annually from the recently  initiated undertaking of the same project  across the  -  fleet. another example is delta’s active role  with air traffic control (atc) and los  angeles international airport (lax) in  implementing eor in   and  .   eor is an improved instrument approach  system that allows atc to clear aircraft  for landing with shorter flight paths. this  system takes advantage of the faa’s  nextgen airspace modernization initiative  and can shorten flight times by  –  minutes. by reducing overall flight time,  this system drives fuel savings and can  help customers reach their destinations  more quickly. this system could provide  an estimated one million gallons in fuel  savings annually at lax alone once fully  utilized. delta’s carbon council meets quarterly  with the executive leadership team  to guide decision-making and drive  continued progress on fuel reduction  initiatives, focusing on both medium-   and long-term progress toward delta’s   net-zero efforts.carbon council focus areas below is an explanation of our five carbon council focus   areas to reduce fuel consumption, along with previous  examples of their successful implementation:  fixed weight: reducing the permanently installed weight on the  plane (e.g., radial landing gear tires and carbon brakes). variable weight: reducing the boarded weight on the plane   (e.g., reducing the weight of unit load devices like cargo pallets). flying operations: flight routing and planning changes to reduce fuel  burn (e.g., investments in flight planning software and collaboration   with air traffic control regarding establish on required navigation   performance (eor)). additionally, we will continue to seek to  collaborate with governments, airports and others on cross-industry  initiatives. one example of this ongoing collaboration is through the  nextgen advisory committee, which provides independent advice  and recommendations to the faa related to air traffic management. ground operations: investments in ground procedures and  infrastructure to reduce fuel burn while the aircraft is on the ground  (e.g., investments in communications technologies, maintenance pad  electrification, apu ambassadors dedicated to reducing auxiliary  power unit (“apu”) usage while at the gate and partnerships with  innovative companies to accelerate new methods of saving jet fuel  during ground operations). aerodynamic modifications: permanent modifications to aircraft to  improve their aerodynamic performance (e.g., investments in split- scimitar winglets and blade-tip coating research with the u.s. air force).  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix offsets offsets will play a role in compliance with the global  corsia scheme and ultimately achieving net-zero by  . for delta to reach net-zero, out-of-sector solutions will likely complement  fleet, saf, operational initiatives and other in-sector technology improvements.  removal projects that absorb incremental and additional co  from the  atmosphere, such as afforestation and reforestation, or technology, such as  direct air capture and carbon sequestration, will be necessary.  while our primary focus is on decarbonizing aviation and reaching net-zero  by  , we have also supported out-of-sector solutions for many years by  purchasing carbon offsets. deforestation needs to be halted by   to achieve  global climate goals. to further these goals, we continue to support the leaf  (lowering emissions by accelerating forest finance) coalition. this public- private coalition seeks to facilitate significant reductions in ghg emissions  by financing large-scale tropical forest protection through a jurisdictional  approach. leaf works with national and subnational governments to ensure  that all key stakeholders, including indigenous peoples, participate fully and  receive a fair share of the benefits. in  , we purchased and retired $  million of carbon offsets which relate to  a portion of our airline segment's   and first quarter   carbon emissions.   we expect much of the remaining investment to support our goal to spend  $  billion through the end of   toward airline decarbonization focusing on  solutions other than offsets.     in   and q   , delta purchased and retired offsets to cover flights flown and tickets purchased  through march  ,  .  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix ghg emissions inventory  in the ghg

accelerate the  transition to a more sustainable and people-first  future for air travel. in  , we continued our  initiative to largely eliminate single-use plastics  onboard our aircraft and introduced new, more  sustainable products. additionally, we diverted    million pounds of waste from the landfill. we  analyzed passenger consumption to understand  what they consumed onboard, allowing our  team to onboard provisions accordingly.  understanding consumption prevents wasted  products and saves fuel through reduced weight  onboard our aircraft. reducing onboard single-use plastics in early  , we refreshed our onboard product  offerings, and as a result of the initial replacement  strategy, we estimate onboard single-use plastic  consumption is reduced by approximately

, we continue to look for  innovative alternatives to single-use plastic  products. we will explore alternative materials  such as recyclable paper products as a key to  further reduction. our teams also continue to test  a rotable cup program as we assess the viability of  reusable cups on board commercial flights. these  programs are our first steps in   to further  plastic reduction aboard our flights. donations reflective of our sustainability and  giving back culture, we donated  .   million pounds of bedding, amenity kits,  nonperishable food, water and other  items to those in need in

provide  reusable food service items.resuming onboard recycling  many airports halted their recycling programs  during the pandemic. we have been working  with each of these airports to help support  them in all efforts to resume their programs.  our teams continue working with airports  affected by logistical constraints to recycle at  as many locations as possible. through this  hard work, we are currently recycling at    domestic airports.the power of collaboration in  , delta took part in the sky team alliance’s  sustainable flight challenge to test and explore  sustainability solutions. this initiative brought  partner airlines together to share learnings and  innovations with the common goal of reducing the  industry’s carbon footprint.  on the plane our most fuel-efficient aircraft in service at the time,  the  - er, took off powered by a fuel blend that  included   gallons of saf – marking a record for the  largest amount of saf used on a flight out of atlanta.  gevo supplied the saf for this record-breaking flight  through its partnership with our team. the aircraft included specific features to increase  fuel efficiency and reduce drag, including new  landing gear tires that reduce plane weight by    pounds and winglets. one hundred percent electric ground service  equipment (egse) bookended the atlanta to salt lake  city flight with battery-powered tractors and carts that loaded baggage and fuel. as mentioned in previous  sections, we have invested to achieve a  % egse fleet  by the end of  , aiming for  % by the end of    and a  % eligible egse fleet by  .  in the sky  aboard our record-breaking flight, our customer  experience included receiving soft pillows and  blankets made from recycled plastic bottles.  customers seated in first class selected from  an array of more sustainable menu offerings,  such as meat sourced from ranches that practice  regenerative land management and locally grown  vegetables. first class customers choose their  meals before boarding, preventing wasted food on  the flight. we offered all customers gourmet snacks  served in recyclable packaging.  additionally, customer service used no disposable  plastic, recycled all beverage packaging and composted  food scraps and serviceware in salt lake city. this flight  was zero waste, with the exception of safety, health  and hygiene items that must be single-use. the travel experience (continued) we also seek to source alternatives for certain products from which we cannot eliminate waste.   to evaluate whether the alternatives we are sourcing for our onboard service and beyond represent  a more sustainable option, we utilize a life cycle analysis tool to calculate and compare the ghg  footprint and other environmental metrics of different product types.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix ground support equipment  electrification progress  ground support   equipment (gse) progress to reduce fuel

% of electric  core eligible gse in   hubs) by the end of    and a  % electric gse fleet in delta’s hubs  by  . delta is replacing internal combustion  engine (gas and diesel) ground support  equipment units with electrically powered  equivalents. electrified products offer improved  sustainability and emissions (zero operating  emissions, low noise and improved operator  air quality), safety (more safety features and  powertrain control), reliability (fewer moving  parts and complexity), technology (foundation  for future investment) and lower operating  costs (reduced maintenance and fuel costs).  delta reviews multiple aspects of implementing  new products, including safety, environmental  impact and responsible supply chains. delta’s current lithium battery strategy focuses  on lithium iron phosphate due to its increased  safety and cobalt-free chemistry.  in  , we retired over   internal  combustion engine units and replaced them  with over   zero-emissions egse units. we  bought baggage tractors and belt loaders (two  largest fleets) and  % of the purchase was  electrified. delta has doubled its electric fleet  since the inaugural   delta esg report  ( % in   to  % in december  ).electrification across     our key hubs as we continue to electrify, the strong internal  collaboration between divisions, including  corporate real estate, government affairs and  airport customer service (acs), has provided the  groundwork for advancing the electrification of  our operations at delta’s hubs. through terminal  redevelopment efforts at lax, lga and slc, we are  adding the charging capacity needed to convert the  core ground fleets (baggage tractors, belt loaders  and aircraft tow tractors) to  % electric. further  investments in bos and sea charging infrastructure  will support  % electrification of the eligible gse  over the next few years. our focus in the new york  city area (supported by the port authority of new  york and new jersey, iat and others) led to the  replacement of over   gas and diesel units and  electric equivalents in  .  adding to the hub-specific wins, we reduced our  off-road diesel emission rate by  % over the last  four years in california.  the purchase and installation of   ground power  units (gpus) and   preconditioned air (pca)  units from a $ . m partnership with the detroit  metropolitan wayne county airport and the wayne  county airport authority is an example of how  collaboration with local airport authorities and  federal programs accelerates efficiencies across  our operations. in electrifying our gates, we aim to  achieve a reduction of apu usage and, as a result,  overall airport emissions.  expansion of egse depends, in part, on  an adequate supply of alternative electric  equipment and airport investment in  charging infrastructure. we will continue  working closely with our business partners  to test, develop and encourage more egse  options. future investment efforts will center  around airports that are egse ready and have  adequate charging capabilities.      % egse by  ,  % by  ,  % by    •  % egse as of december    • over   electric units added in     • retired over

stakeholders,  building coalitions and  driving policy development we recognize many factors surrounding our  climate goals are outside our control and  will require significant capital investment,  government policies and incentives, dedicated  research and development and transformation  of some of the world’s largest industries. two  critical components of advancing and achieving  our climate goals are effective public policy  engagement and stakeholder engagement  across sectors within and outside the aviation  industry to bring cost-effective solutions under  all levers to scale. we have joined coalitions and partnerships  centered around guiding ambitions. we  describe a selection of those partnerships and  coalitions here. our team is advancing other  important initiatives through the faa’s nextgen  advisory committee, providing advice and  recommendations to the faa related to air  traffic management and system modernization.accelerating the development of  sustainable

informs our approach to climate  and decarbonization. as part of an industry that operates globally and is difficult to  decarbonize, airlines are susceptible to climate-related risks  such as extreme weather and increasing fuel costs. identifying  and understanding those risks and their potential impacts on  our business is an important part of framing our overall climate  strategy in response to an ever-changing climate landscape.  our enterprise risk management framework integrates specific  climate risks into safety and security, operational, strategic,  financial and legal and compliance risk assessments. in  ,  delta conducted a climate scenario analysis to inform further  and strengthen our understanding and management of  potential climate-related risks.process for identifying transition risks  risks arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy, including  policy and legal, technology, market and reputation, may impact  how we do business. to evaluate these risks, we applied three of the  iea’s   world energy outlook (weo) scenarios, including:  ynet-zero emissions by   (nze) that sets out a pathway  to achieve net-zero co  emissions by   and is in line with  limiting temperature increase to no more than  . °c   ysustainable development scenario (sds) that is consistent  with the “well below  °c” goal of the paris agreement while  achieving universal energy access and improving air quality   ystated policies scenario (steps) that reflects current policies  that are already in place, as well as those announced by  governments and under development  we show the emissions trajectory and temperature outcomes  of the three scenarios used in the analysis to project a  particular future state of the world. gdp and population growth  assumptions were held consistent across scenarios. for each  scenario, we evaluated broad cross-cutting policy frameworks,  detailed transport sector policies in regions in which delta  operates and forecasted prices of carbon and crude oil.process for identifying physical risks  the airline industry relies largely on business models  concentrating operations in major airports globally. an extended  interruption or disruption resulting from climate-related events,  such as flooding in connection with rising sea levels at an airport  where we have significant operations could have a material  adverse effect on business. we evaluated   airport locations  –  domestic and   international – strategically important to our  business to better understand our exposure to potential climate- related disruptions. for each location, we conducted a physical  risk assessment to evaluate the risk of flooding and sea level rise,  extreme weather events and increased temperature. the baseline scenario used was rcp  .  (representative  concentration pathway), the perceived worst-case high emissions  scenario where emissions are allowed to exceed cautionary  levels and global temperature rises by about  . °c by  . this  scenario is projected to cause irreversible damage to our planet’s  stability. when projecting an airport location to experience  notable impact from certain physical risks like rcp  . , we used  a lower emissions scenario where the global temperature rises  only by about  . °c by   to evaluate physical risks under a less  dramatic scenario. our physical risk assessment focused on  .climate scenario analysis methodology  the analysis followed the international energy agency (iea) and intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) frameworks to  explore a range of plausible climate scenarios and evaluate potential business implications from transition and physical risks, respectively.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix key transition risks  short-term: before  ; medium-term:  – ; long-term:   and beyond   risk type potential financial/operational impacttime   horizonmanagement strategies policy/legalcarbon pricing mechanisms could increase the price of aircraft fuel and could significantly impact  our operating costs. we may be exposed to duplicative emissions pricing if a “patchwork” of  international carbon schemes are applied as opposed to a harmonized global approach. an increase in saf mandates in various jurisdictions may result in increased operating costs due  to the saf premium or penalty in cases where saf supply is not sufficient to meet the mandate.  additional regulatory policies governing aircraft emissions in the u.s. or abroad may increase our  compliance costs.medium, longwe monitor emerging regulations to understand potential risks and opportunities. we engage with policymakers and industry associations to advocate for solutions  to decarbonize our industry and advocate for a global approach to addressing ghg  emissions from international aviation. technology our climate goals rely on continued investment in fleet renewal, saf and development of other  technologies that are not commercially available or available at scale today. the cost to transition  to lower emissions technology could result in increased capital investments in technology  deployment, research and development (saf or aircraft) or additional costs to adopt new  technologies.medium, longwe have established sustainability considerations as one of our key core pillars  that guide our fleet strategy and our capital allocation decisions with respect to  the fleet. a commitment to efficiency improvements from fleet renewal is expected  to reduce ghg emissions intensity until new aircraft technologies that will further  reduce emissions are available at scale. we are committed to engaging our stakeholders to help bring alternative fuels  and new technologies to scale for the industry, including through public-private  partnerships, such as the first movers coalition, focused on unlocking solutions for  hard-to-abate sectors. these partnerships and coalitions focus on bringing saf to market faster by  influencing policy developments to support the production of saf.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix risk type potential financial/operational impacttime   horizonmanagement strategies market business air travel could decline or recover at slower rates due to the increased use of alternatives  such as virtual meetings and events. this could result in a decline in revenue. demand for short-haul, regional flights could shift to lower-carbon alternatives such as high-speed  rail in certain regions. although such shifts are not expected to be material to delta, this could also  result in a decline in revenue. in addition to risks from potential changes to environmental regulation and policy, the transition  to lower-carbon technologies, such as saf, or changes in consumer preferences resulting from  a negative perception of the environmental impact of air travel could materially adversely affect  our business and financial results. for example, lower-carbon technologies such as saf and direct  air capture are currently not available at scale and may take decades to develop and the cost to  transition to them could be prohibitively expensive without appropriate government policies and  incentives in place.short,  medium, longwe understand that climate change impacts from air travel are a concern for our  customers, particularly corporate customers, as many are building “return to travel”  programs that have business travel reduction goals in order to meet climate metrics.  we have announced our intention to set ambitious science-based targets to address  our ghg emissions while still providing efficient transport for our customers. we also engage our corporate customers on sustainability by providing emissions  data regarding their travel, along with opportunities to invest in saf together to  address our shared scope   and scope   emissions using an in-sector solution. we believe our proactive climate strategy positions us to be an industry leader in  sustainability to hedge against market shifts in consumer preferences. reputationour reputation among customers could be impacted if we fail to make progress toward and  achieve our ambitious climate goals. not meeting climate goals or not setting aggressive industry  targets may result in customers, investors and ngos seeking more substantial improvements in  the commercial airline sector. these risks could impact delta’s market share and revenue or result  in a shift away from air travel more broadly.medium, longmaintaining our reputation and global brand is critical to our business. we have  announced our intention to set ambitious climate goals and are diligently working  to establish a transition plan to achieve our goals. we intend to reduce emissions  through various levers as described previously. we also plan to continue to transparently communicate our actions and progress  toward our goals and to work closely with our stakeholders to understand and seek  to meet their expectations.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix

community governance appendix environmental compliance the environmental compliance & health teams establish delta’s strategy,  policies and systems to support compliance and implementation of best  management practices to minimize environmental impacts and protect the  health of our employees, customers and the communities we serve.  the programs serve as the environmental foundation of our sustainability efforts.  ythe environmental compliance team provides subject matter expertise and program  oversight for air quality, water quality, waste management and disposal, remediation   of environmental contamination, emergency response and represents delta in  interactions with federal, state and local environmental agencies.  ythe environmental health team provides expertise and program oversight for industrial  hygiene/workplace exposure, chemical management, aircraft drinking water compliance  and represents delta in interactions with government agencies responsible for  environmental, workplace health and safety and certain product regulation   including, for example, osha, epa, food and drug administration (fda) and   the u.s. department of health and human services (hhs).  as our operations continued to increase throughout  , approaching and, in some  cases, surpassing   levels, our environmental metrics remained relatively consistent.  one exception was an increase in the number of environmental releases in  . when  environmental releases occur, the environmental team works across our operating  divisions to ensure prompt notification, thorough response to minimize and mitigate any  environmental impact and investigation with corrective actions to prevent recurrences.compliance management delta continues to use three system tools  to manage our environmental programs,  reduce risk and minimize the impacts   of our operations. delta’s environmental management  system (ems) outlines the overarching  components of our environmental systems  and processes and is modeled after the  iso   framework. the ems manages  and tracks roles, responsibilities and  procedures for compliance with regulations  and implementation of best management  practices on an airport-specific basis. delta’s environmental programs manual  (epm) establishes delta’s policies,  expectations and management protocols  for internal environmental compliance  with federal, state and local regulations  and best management practices that go  beyond compliance. the epm sets forth  environmental training requirements for  employees and provides the forms, tools  and resources to demonstrate compliance  and reduce risk.delta’s environmental management  information system (emis) is a web-based  tool that tracks internal environmental tasks  outlined in the epm. emis provides proactive  notifications to station task owners to stay  ahead of compliance tasks and generates  reports to validate task completion.  introduction safety people environment climate

climate advocacy coordination in  , we accelerated our efforts to build a  more sustainable and people-first future by  leading on climate policy issues. acting on that  commitment, delta created the new role of vice  president, government affairs – sustainability,  based in washington, dc reporting to our global  head of government affairs with a dotted line  to our chief sustainability officer. the new  function reflects a best practice in responsible  climate lobbying by creating a focal point for  leading and coordinating delta’s advocacy  strategies on international, federal, state and  local climate policies. this structure empowers  the entire government affairs function to  strategically and collaboratively advance the  company’s climate goals in coordination with  our business units.climate lobbying principles as part of the highly regulated global aviation industry, we advocate for climate change policies that will help  us achieve our climate goals. this requires concerted efforts to commercialize the nascent saf industry and  support breakthrough innovations in aircraft design. our climate change policy principles provide a foundation  for our advocacy and ensure consistency in our position development process. as a basis for navigating policies  across the global markets, we embrace internationally and nationally harmonized policies to prevent the  inconsistent application of policies that may result in competitive market distortions or send conflicting market  signals. u.s. law, for example, recognizes the need for national consistency in aircraft regulation and preempts  state and local regulation. delta believes climate policy for the aviation industry should also be:  . sector-specific but augmented by  complementary policies to support our broader  sustainability strategy (e.g., electrification of  ground support equipment and operations);  . preventative of revenue diversion for non-aviation  climate mitigation purposes, ensuring we reinvest  any revenue generated into this hard-to-abate  sector and the diverse workforce it supports;  . grounded in science to ensure ghg emissions  reductions are maximized and realized in a  manner designed to minimize increased costs  for travelers;  . performance-based, feedstock- and technology- neutral, recognizing the innovations needed to  decarbonize our sector are not yet commercially  available at scale; . supportive of the long-term capital investment  necessary to sustain multi-decade aviation  infrastructure and equipment commitments;  . rooted in the need for operational safety,  technological feasibility and economic  reasonableness;  . designed to drive efficiency in fleet  procurement, fuel burn and air traffic  operations; and  . designed to incentivize rather than mandate  a zero-carbon trajectory at the lowest cost  (e.g., tax incentives, grants, r&d investment,  voluntary opt-in), as there is no scalable market  where saf can compete on a level playing field  with the on-road fuels market.climate lobbying this section of our esg report highlights our climate lobbying activities in which we  have engaged directly and indirectly through trade associations from january  ,  ,  through december  ,  . this section updates our   climate lobbying report,  released in march   and consistent with that report, includes climate-related  lobbying activities by or on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary monroe energy,  llc (monroe), which operates the trainer refinery and related pipelines and terminal  assets that supply jet fuel to our airline operations throughout the northeastern u.s. consistent with this commitment to  climate policy leadership, we strive for our  coordinated lobbying activities and those of our  membership-based trade associations to jointly  support our climate goals. we constructively  engage with our trade associations on climate  policy and strategically engage with climate  policy thought leaders, such as various  environmental ngos, think tanks and coalitions.  the following sections address our direct and  indirect climate lobbying activities, as well as  certain lobbying activities of monroe, over the  course of   and evaluate areas of actual or  perceived misalignment with our climate goals  and policy principles.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix direct climate lobbying federal in  , the administration and congress advanced the largest  investments in climate change policy in history, putting the united  states on a path to achieve a roughly  % reduction in ghg  emissions by   and setting the stage for strong, incentive- based global leadership. notably, the administration accelerated  its   saf grand challenge commitment by finalizing a  comprehensive saf grand challenge roadmap, outlining a  government-wide strategy for scaling up saf production in the u.s.  and serving as a replicable model for international partners. as part of delta’s advocacy efforts in  , we positively influenced  the federal policy environment through several key efforts targeting  government funding, stakeholder engagement, legislative advocacy  and regulatory implementation. specifically:  . we directly advocated for increased funding and resources  for the multiple federal agencies supporting the saf grand  challenge. for example, we advocated in support of the  federal aviation administration’s (faa) continuous lower  energy emissions and noise (cleen) program and its center  of excellence for alternative jet fuels and environment  (ascent) as well as the department of energy’s (doe)  bioenergy technologies office (beto) to support the  development of saf at commercial scale.  . we also participated in stakeholder engagement with federal  agencies and policymakers to inform the development of the  final roadmap.   . we actively advocated alongside our supply chain and  industry partners to support federal legislation to promote the  development of the saf market via targeted tax incentives and  grants. specifically, we supported the enactment of the saf  provisions in the inflation reduction act (ira) and in its earlier  iterations (e.g., build back better  . ) as well as standalone  policy measures such as the sustainable skies act and the  aviation emissions reduction opportunity (aero) act.   . within the ira, we also supported provisions that will enable  the development of next-generation power to liquids (ptl)  technology, among other breakthroughs – key to achieving  net-zero emissions – including incentives for renewable  electricity, clean hydrogen and carbon capture technologies.  additional policy measures of significance included the first- ever commercial ev credit and new as well as expanded loan  guarantee authorities at doe.  . following the enactment of the ira, we centered our advocacy  around implementation and coordinated with supply chain  and industry partners to file select comments with the u.s. department of treasury and the internal revenue service  (irs), encouraging flexibility in the interpretation of the law  to maximize emissions reductions. we also set our sights on  developing a coordinated advocacy strategy to support future  bipartisan investment in saf policy, given the short-term  nature of the newly enacted saf incentives. state we laid the foundation for long-term engagement on saf policy  deployment and advocated for supportive policies to accelerate  investment in saf production in existing as well as new markets,  with a prioritization on states where our hub operations are located.  in georgia (ga) and minnesota (mn), we fostered foundational  discussions with multiple public and private stakeholders (e.g.,  ga forestry commission, bioeconomy coalition of mn) to  create saf ecosystems and directly influenced the development  of the mn clean fuels standard (cfs) report. we also actively  supported saf incentive legislation in california, new york,  kentucky, illinois and hawaii.    introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix international united nations international civil aviation organization (icao) on the international level,   marked the convening of the  triannual  st assembly of the un’s international civil aviation  organization (icao). the assembly resulted in the adoption of a  long-term aspirational goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions  for international aviation by  , representing one of the only  global sector-specific goals of its kind, as well as the adoption of a  new baseline –  % of   levels – for stabilizing ghg emissions  from international aviation under icao’s carbon offsetting and  reduction scheme for international aviation (corsia).  in partnership with a a and the international air transport  association (iata), we directly supported the long-term goal  and the important role of corsia as the only market-based  measure governing international aviation emissions over a  patchwork of individual or duplicative regulations (e.g., eu ets),  which can be problematic for an international industry. we  also expressed concerns with the final baseline compromise,  advocating to maintain the corsia baseline at  % of    levels for the duration of the program. notably, the new baseline  roughly doubles the costs of the program, potentially diverting  billions in limited resources from preferred in-sector emissions  reduction measures, such as saf, to out-of-sector offsets. moving  forward, we believe it will be important for the united states to encourage the prioritization of saf over offsets, to ensure  structural decarbonization through additional policy supports  and incentives, as well as take appropriate steps to implement  corsia domestically with appropriate safeguards to protect the  competitiveness of the u.s. industry. european union (eu) in the eu, we again coordinated with our trade associations. we  advocated for the eu to adopt incentives for saf development  and deployment, noting that the refuel eu saf mandate  contained in the eu’s fit for   package seeks to drive saf  supply without appropriate incentives to enable cost-effective  investment. also, consistent with our support for harmonized  global policies, we advocated for the exclusion of extra-european  flights under the eu ets to avoid undermining corsia and  potentially adding duplicative charges and obligations for  international aviation emissions.direct climate lobbying (continued) examples of our advocacy include:  yin california, we directly advocated with industry and supply  chain partners – inclusive of a robust media campaign – for  significant budget support for increased saf production as well  as for legislation (ab ) directing the california air resources  board to study and develop a plan for increased saf incentives  in its   scoping plan.   yin illinois, we worked with a coalition of airlines and producers  to successfully advance legislation (hb ) providing a  - year purchasers’ incentive for saf to help offset the state’s jet  fuel tax, which will be implemented in the summer of  .   yin hawaii, we successfully advocated to ensure saf was eligible  for the reinstated renewable fuels production tax credit  (sb ) and worked with our trade association to advance the  enactment of a new low carbon fuel advisory board, inclusive  of a commercial airline board member.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix monroe – direct lobbying at the federal, state and local levels, we also engaged in lobbying activities designed to reduce costs and enhance  options for compliance flexibility associated with monroe’s operation of the trainer refinery. we own monroe as  part of our strategy to mitigate the cost and supply risks associated with jet fuel. however, monroe has experienced  significant economic hardship under the federal renewable fuel standard (rfs) because of a lack of transparency  and other flaws in the renewable identification number (rin) credit scheme under that program, which make  compliance costs prohibitive due to arbitrarily high rins prices. this market failure undermines the larger goals  and objectives of the rfs program. it is inconsistent with the original policy intentions of the program. as such, we  have supported monroe’s efforts to seek policy reform measures to reduce the significant financial impact on the  operation by advocating for transparent policies, such as lower volume requirements that better align with market  supply and demand as well as a rins’ price cap to provide greater pricing stability and eliminate the opaque nature  of the rins market. our advocacy intends to provide monroe with greater financial certainty and economic flexibility  to invest in the business, including investment in advancing its sustainability and climate objectives.  we have also leveraged monroe’s unique vantage point and expertise to inform our engagement with a a and our  value chain partners across the ecosystem to encourage the adoption of regulatory measures that may better incent  saf production. for example, we supported efforts to further update the environmental protection agency’s (epa)  biointermediates rule under the rfs and advance more expedient pathway petition approvals, the lack of which  restricts the saf industry’s growth by preventing the generation of rins for fuel (e.g., co-processed jet fuel) produced  from biocrude or other feedstock materials, among other items. notably, as monroe and other existing fossil fuel  refiners evaluate opportunities for saf deployment in the us, the volatility of the rfs rins market is a major deterrent  to sustained investment in saf by creating significant challenges for companies underwriting the economics of saf  production. additionally, the lower ethanol-equivalency value for most types of saf compared to renewable diesel under  the rfs places saf at a competitive disadvantage in the renewable fuels market. therefore, our monroe-specific climate  advocacy remains aligned with our larger climate goals and objectives as we look to advance policies that will help  catalyze the saf marketplace and help bring monroe into our net-zero vision.indirect climate lobbying in addition to direct lobbying activities, we are members of sector-specific and  multi-sectoral industry trade associations that engage in lobbying on a variety of

for reasons unrelated to climate or policy matters.  however, delta was a member of the u.s. chamber’s task  force on climate actions, which was established by member  companies seeking to influence the climate policy positioning  of the chamber from within and provides a platform for direct  business engagement with diverse stakeholders influencing  climate policy development. through the task force and in  other forums, delta advocated for climate policies that support  our sectoral interests, such as incentives for saf and related  research and development to support advanced propulsion  systems and next-generation fuels.   introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix business roundtable (brt) about climate change position areas of influence & alignment brt is an association of chief executive officers  of america’s leading companies working to  promote a thriving u.s. economy and expanded  opportunity for all americans through  public policy. for more than   years, the  membership of brt has applied ceo expertise  to the major issues facing the nation.the brt believes that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world  must work together to limit global temperature rise this century to well below   °c above preindustrial levels, consistent with the paris agreement. the brt also  acknowledges that the intergovernmental panel on climate change’s   report  limiting warming to no more than  . °c compared to preindustrial levels will be  necessary to avoid some of the most severe risks associated with climate change.  the brt supports a goal of reducing net u.s. ghg emissions by at least  % from    levels by  . the brt has developed a suite of principles by which u.s. climate policy should be  guided, including but not limited to the following:  yalign policy goals and ghg emissions reduction targets with science  yincrease global engagement, cooperation and accountability  yprovide adequate transition time and long-term regulatory certainty  yensure that u.s. policies account for international emissions                      reduction programs in  , the brt developed and adopted a “roadmap for u.s. energy policy,” which  includes a list of policy recommendations in response to the war in ukraine and its  impact on global energy markets. the recommendations included, among other  measures, accelerating the clean energy transition and reducing overall energy  demand. during cop , the brt hosted bipartisan conversations to advance global  climate action. delta’s ceo is a member of the brt. in addition, delta  participates in the brt’s climate, environmental and  governance committees at a staff level and leverages the  organization for direct engagement opportunities with  diverse stakeholders influencing climate change policy. this  enables us to provide input into the development of brt  policy position papers and resources. we are appreciative of the brt’s recognition that while a  market-based climate strategy should apply broadly across  the economy, no one policy or approach can fully address  climate change across such a diverse economy and such  diverse sources of ghg emissions. the brt’s formal policy  also notes that in unique circumstances, non-duplicative,  tailored policies may be more effective or administratively  feasible. for example, some emissions sources may face  unique technological challenges or are subject to separate  international agreements to limit emissions, such as corsia.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers (afpm)  about climate change position areas of influence & alignment afpm is the leading trade association representing the fuel and  petrochemical manufacturing and refining industry. its mission includes, educating policymakers, the media and  the public on the value its members and their products provide  the nation and the world as well as providing strategic business  and technical information to its members, among other items.afpm is committed to engaging in the discussion and  development of sound climate change policies. the association  acknowledges climate change is real and is committed to  the development of sound policies that enable its members  to supply the fuel and petrochemicals that growing global  populations and economies need to thrive and to do so in an  environmentally sustainable way. policies addressing climate  change must be:  ybalanced and

jobs and emissions from the united states to  other countries  yharmonized, preemptive and economy-wide  ysimple and transparent  yachievable and flexible to adjust, as necessarymonroe is a dues-paying member of afpm. it has a  representative on afpm’s board of directors (as do all other  members) and on afpm’s executive committee. monroe also  has representatives on issue-specific committees, including  environmental, fuels and government relations. monroe works alongside afpm to advance policies that  mitigate the economic hardship of rfs compliance as well   as a diverse array of matters impacting the overall industry. from a climate change lens, monroe is working with afpm  to increase its thought leadership and engagement on the  role the refining industry can play in the decarbonization of  hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and heavy-duty trucking,  including with respect to the role of saf. as the fuel and  petrochemical industries transition toward more sustainable  fuels and feedstocks, monroe’s engagement in afpm provides  opportunities for delta to send further demand signals for saf  production and to build relationships with prospective saf  producers as well as a platform for monroe to explore potential  saf production pathways.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix analysis we have evaluated the lobbying activities of  the trade associations above for alignment  with our climate goals and policy principles.  we analyzed alignment based on (i) whether the trade  association has a climate position that supports the  achievement of net-zero emissions by   and/ or temperature  goals identified by the intergovernmental panel on climate  change (ipcc) as the scientific underpinning of the paris  agreement and (ii) whether specific trade association climate  lobbying activities were consistent with our climate goals.  the aviation-specific associations in which we are members  have expressed strong support for achieving ghg emissions  reductions in line with science, with both a a and iata having  ambitious net-zero goals. the advocacy efforts of a a and iata are geared toward  advancing government policies and regulations that will support  achieving their climate goals and opposing potential measures  that would be harmful or counterproductive to reaching these  ambitions. thus, they align with our climate goals and principles.  in some cases, approaches may differ yet continue to be aligned  on goals and outcomes. the following are some illustrative  examples which we believe are consistent with our climate goals. . as discussed under our direct international advocacy, corsia  is designed to stabilize international aviation emissions and  is a multilateral, global approach, which is preferred to a  patchwork of regional and jurisdictional approaches that may  result in duplicative measures covering the same emissions.  a a and iata advocated for the continued use of   as  a baseline for calculating offsetting obligations beyond the  pilot phase of corsia to reduce dependence on out-of-sector  offsets and further incentivize and facilitate the use of saf to  help decarbonize aviation operations.   . a a and iata have generally opposed saf mandates that  do not also include incentives that are well-designed to  ensure a sufficient supply of saf at competitive market  prices and avoid competitive distortions. this opposition  reflects the aviation industry’s concern that mandates  alone, without incentives designed to encourage supply and  reasonable pricing, will not support the industry’s ambitious  decarbonization goals. delta, a a and iata have therefore  advocated for the eu to adopt incentives in addition to  mandates to develop the saf market and close the gap  between traditional jet fuel and saf. collectively, we have also  encouraged the adoption of a book-and-claim saf accounting  system as a means of improving the functionality of a  mandated policy for a nascent market by providing greater  supply flexibility.  . additionally, iata has opposed the eu’s power to liquids (ptl)  sub-mandate, which is at an even more nascent stage than  saf. data demonstrate that prematurely requiring ptl could  unintentionally increase emissions in the eu where there is an  insufficient existing renewable energy supply to support green hydrogen in the early years of the program, undermining  the objectives of the mandate. this position aligns with our  principle that climate policy be grounded in science.   . a a and iata have opposed environmental taxes and fees  where the revenue collected goes to national treasuries rather  than aviation climate mitigation efforts, resulting in increased  costs for travelers and the industry without corresponding  benefits for the climate. increased costs to the industry also  reduce the ability of airlines to invest in new and more fuel- efficient aircraft and technologies.  . a a and iata advocate for globally aligned and coordinated  measures to ensure that applicable measures are most  effective and efficient and that airlines do not pay multiple  times for the same ton of emissions. without global  harmonization, a patchwork of regional or national measures  would only serve to increase the administrative burden  and cost for airlines that often operate across multiple  jurisdictions and distract from the sustained investments  required to achieve long-term decarbonization. • relatedly, at the state level through a a, we opposed  efforts by california and hawaii to advance state-specific  regulatory and legislative actions on federal preemption  grounds. notably, we opposed the regulation of aviation  ghg emissions by the california air resources board as  well as the imposition of a state carbon tax on jet fuel  (hb  and sb ). both positions are consistent with  our principle of supporting harmonized national and  international approaches to reducing aircraft emissions.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix  . iata has opposed per-flight emissions disclosures at the national  level due to variance in emissions methodologies by state that  could lead to inconsistent and non-comparable disclosures  and instead urged that any such requirements use a standard  international methodology, which iata is currently developing.     with respect to delta’s non-aviation-specific trade  associations, the u.s. chamber has not specifically taken a  public position on the stated temperature goals identified  by the ipcc, which does not align with delta’s climate goals;  however, the chamber has developed a clear climate change  policy position and actively supported u.s. participation in the  paris agreement while facilitating direct business engagement  during cop . the brt also facilitated business engagement  during cop , and its climate change position indicates  alignment with the stated temperature goals identified by the  ipcc. however, its current   ambition is not a net-zero goal.  • there may be areas of perceived misalignment from the  lobbying activities of these two organizations. for example,  the chamber and brt actively opposed, on tax policy  grounds, the overall inflation reduction act (ira) legislative  package, which contained a variety of climate change-related  provisions, including incentives to support saf development,  which delta actively supported - although we did not take  a position on the non-climate change related provisions  of the broader package. following direct engagement  from member companies, the brt expressed support for  the provisions that incentivized clean energy technology  deployment and the u.s. chamber pointed to its growing  support for bipartisan clean energy policies and expressed  disappointment that the climate and clean energy provisions  were tied to partisan legislation that they could not support. both organizations were ultimately criticized by ngos and other  groups for their positions; however, we do not find their lobbying  activities to be inconsistent, given their analysis extended beyond  the climate policy provisions of the legislation.  with respect to climate lobbying activity undertaken by  our aviation and non-aviation trade associations, a a, brt  and the u.s. chamber filed comments on the securities and  exchange commission’s (sec) climate risk disclosure proposal  noting their support for more transparent and comparable  climate-related disclosures while raising significant concerns  around key provisions of the specific proposal. each association  expressed an intention to work constructively with the sec to  advance a reporting regime that is grounded in the sec’s long- standing concepts of materiality and that advances meaningful,  decision-useful climate-related disclosures without being overly  burdensome, complex or prescriptive. a a, also provided airline- specific contextualization to demonstrate the range of interests  and dynamics impacting our industry. we do not view any of  these comments as inconsistent with our climate policies. as  part of the iterative process, it is essential that trade associations  provide sufficient input to inform this and future rulemakings  governing disclosures.  • relatedly, at the state level, california sought to advance  its own climate risk-disclosure proposal (sb ), which  would have required reporting scope  ,   and   emissions  by corporations with over $  billion in annual revenue. a a  opposed this legislation as duplicative of pending federal and  international disclosure regimes, which is consistent with  our climate policy principle of advancing harmonized policy  approaches that mitigate redundancy.with respect to monroe’s trade association engagement,  afpm has not specifically taken a public position on the stated  temperature goals identified by the ipcc nor actively engaged in  the cop process; however, afpm has developed a climate change  policy position, reflected in the previous table. this lack of clarity  and engagement regarding the science-based temperature goals  has resulted in criticism from ngos and certain other organizations  and is inconsistent with delta’s climate goals. there are also  specific areas with respect to recent lobbying activities, including  afpm’s lack of support for the saf provisions in the ira, where we  disagree. in our assessment, afpm partially took issue with the  bill’s treatment of liquid fuels, expressing concern with a perceived  lack of recognition for their role in advancing a cleaner and  more energy secure future. in contrast, delta actively supported  the saf provisions within the bill as an important first step for  scaling the market while acknowledging areas of improvement  needed to provide investment certainty. while there are areas  of misalignment, monroe’s engagement with afpm has helped  facilitate increased thought leadership and engagement within the  association around the role of saf and other clean fuel solutions for  hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, which is supportive of delta’s  saf goal. additionally, as the operator of an independent refinery,  monroe has utilized its membership in afpm as part of its rfs  compliance and risk mitigation strategy to seek permanent reform  to the rfs program for the reasons explained previously.  however, it is important to note that advocacy is only one element  of monroe’s engagement with afpm. it utilizes its membership  to stay informed on, and to contribute to, best practices in the  industry, covering a variety of issues beyond climate change  including but not limited to safety, environmental stewardship and  operational performance. therefore, we believe the overall benefits  of engagement outweigh the identified concerns.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community governance appendix engagement is an important  lever of influence ultimately, we continue to believe our participation in diverse and  multi-sector industry organizations, given our ambitious climate  goals, helps positively influence the development and execution  of climate policy positions and advocacy efforts. participation in  industry trade associations facilitates the identification, assessment  and mitigation of risks and maximization of opportunities associated  with emerging policy issues through constructive internal  engagement and external advocacy, as appropriate. with the continued utilization of our climate policy principles, we  are sharing our expectations for climate advocacy with our trade  associations and other stakeholders. while we do not always agree  with the views or tactics of these trade associations, we believe they  provide a valuable opportunity to understand the perspectives of  various industry participants as we develop and evolve our advocacy  strategy. we are committed to engaging in the collaborative  problem-solving process and to working with our industry peers  and other organizations in these political frameworks. where we  disagree with one or more of these trade associations on a matter  tied to our strategy, we have in the past taken, and may in the future  take, independent actions to mitigate any risks an association’s  actions may present to our strategy. as the aviation and fossil fuel industries transition toward  more sustainable climate solutions, delta continues to evaluate  operational pathways for integrating monroe into a net-zero  future – which includes rfs reform – and plans to continue  to evaluate trade association climate policy positions while  advancing opportunities to drive constructive change toward  the advancement of our climate goals. conclusion delta appreciates that many factors surrounding our ambitious  climate goals are outside our control and will require significant  capital investment, government policies and incentives,  dedicated research and development and the transformation  of some of the world’s largest industries. as highlighted in this  section, one critical component of the advancement and ultimate  achievement of our climate goals is effective public policy  engagement, including direct and indirect lobbying activities.  delta remains committed to being a voice of leadership on  climate policy issues, including through trade associations.  introduction safety people environment climate lobbying community
