communities,  and our people take care of each other.  as we welcomed thousands of southwest employees into  the company, we made new hires feel welcomed, cared for,  and appreciated. we reintroduced our wingmate program, similar to a program unveiled during the airtran integration.  wingmates are southwest employees who reach out to new  hires and welcome them to the southwest family and our  culture. volunteering as a wingmate is an opportunity for  current employees to contribute to our staffing, retention  efforts, and culture.  partnering with teams across the company, we identified ways  to improve our onboarding program to help provide our new  people with the best onboarding experience possible. one of  those opportunities included sending a welcome box to new  employees’ homes that featured a message from southwest  president & ceo bob jordan. similar to a college acceptance  packet, the boxes created a dynamic start to the onboarding  experience. they instantly

the unique  perspective and skills necessary to lead southwest airlines  into the future.  ● mentorship program:  a six-month formal mentorship  pairing between two southwest employees. after  choosing a focus area, a mentee receives a mentor who can help them grow in that focus. employees at the  company for at least six months can be a mentee, and  all are encouraged to take advantage of this program,  whether their goal is to learn a new skill, explore a  different part of the business, or grow in leadership.  while there are many ways for employees to develop  themselves professionally and personally, mentorship  provides a unique opportunity to learn from one another  and build new relationships. every pairing receives a  mentorship guidebook, extensive internal and external  resources, and support from the mentorship program  team to help create meaningful connections.  from a talent perspective,   was a milestone year. and  despite a difficult labor market,

think about the  world differently. the term neurodiversity describes the range  of differences in brain function and behavioral traits among  individuals. some conditions recognized as neurodivergent  include autism spectrum disorder (asd), attention deficit  hyperactivity disorder (adhd), asperger's syndrome,  dyspraxia, dyslexia, and tourette syndrome. in support of southwest's continued commitment to dei,  the company introduced a campus reach neurodiversity  internship program for eligible part-time and full-time  college students. this program is designed for neurodiverse  individuals with an autism spectrum disorder. we welcomed  our first group of these interns to the southwest family in  the summer of  , eager to hear their fresh ideas and  perspectives, and see the impact they’d have, not only within  their workgroups or departments but our business overall.  students selected for the program immerse themselves in  southwest’s campus reach program, receive mentorship,  and discover various career development opportunities  throughout the summer. interns and their leaders also receive  access to a job coach during the internship for additional  support. the campus reach neurodiversity program is part  of a journey to remove barriers that may otherwise limit  neurodiverse individuals from fully showcasing their strengths,  abilities, and potential in the workforce.         southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report people people people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship people performance planet

spends so much time in the air, some   may be surprised to discover just how many ways we’re  working to address our emissions footprint on the ground.   we remain focused on improving efficiency across our ground  operations, from our aircraft to equipment and facilities.  we continue to make progress in gse electrification. the  equipment most suited for electrification includes bag tugs,  beltloaders, pushbacks, and power stows. as of december   , we’ve electrified   % of all eligible southwest gse,  and at   of our airports, we have electrified over  % of  eligible gse. we plan to continue electrifying commercially  available and operationally feasible equipment. additionally,  there are procedures to use electric ground power and  preconditioned air for aircraft at the gate whenever available,  which reduces the use of auxiliary power units (apu) and  helps avoid additional emissions on the ground. every minute  the apu is off, we save   .   gallons of jet fuel, which adds up  over time. we were recognized by the port of seattle with the    aviation award for greatest airline use of ground power  systems to reduce emissions while docked at seattle-tacoma  international airport (sea) gates. southwest demonstrated a  high use of emission-reducing ground power systems   ( - % of all operations connect to the system), and longest  connectivity to ground power systems while at the gate.  in  , we also rolled out our central monitoring system  (cms) to more airports. our cms streamlines airport ground  operations by enabling us to digitally monitor systems and  equipment such as baggage handling systems, glycol  (deicing) equipment, passenger boarding bridges, as well as  resources like ground power and preconditioned air, in real- time. as of december  , our cms is operational in some  capacity at   airports (   more compared with  ), with  planned expansion to four additional airports in  . our  cms is operational at airports that cover approximately   %  of  all scheduled southwest flights as of december  . energy and recycling we continue to seek opportunities to address our  environmental impact at our facilities. in  , our brand  new denver international airport (den) hangar was awarded  leadership in energy and environmental design (leed)  certification. items that contributed to this certification  included: n ine electric vehicle charging stations , innovative  translucent wall panels to provide daylighting, automated  led lighting, and  less than   pounds of waste generated  per square foot of construction. additionally, our corporate  facilities and environmental sustainability teams partnered to  perform a facility condition assessment and energy analysis  at our corporate campus. as a result of this work, southwest  developed an energy roadmap with a goal to reduce our  energy consumption in our corporate campus in dallas by    % by    relative to a   baseline as well as align to the  company's overall net zero by   goal. our sustainability efforts go beyond just saving fuel to address  our emissions. in  , we further implemented waste  reduction initiatives across our operations. we launched a new  training module on recycling, as well as an internal webpage  that made recycling education and information accessible to  all employees. we also evaluated recycling availability across  all of our airports and continued to engage with employees  on ways to enhance and improve onboard recycling.  additionally, through our repurpose with purpose program,  we’ve partnered with organizations to upcycle thousands of  pounds of leather seat coverings (made from  % recycled  leather waste) , which helps keep those items out of landfills.  in  , inflight operations partnered with the environmental  sustainability team to host a one-month employee uniform  recycling pop-up event for employees based in our dallas  (dal) location. nearly    pounds of uniforms  were

was another year of progress toward that goal .   we began utilizing saf in our operations, made  a first-of-its-kind investment for southwest, and  were the first commercial airline to bring saf to  oakland international airport.   saf is fuel produced from non-fossil fuel sources that can  result in lower ghg emissions than conventional jet fuel  on a lifecycle basis. as a fully certified drop-in fuel when  blended with conventional jet fuel in accordance with industry  standards, saf is compatible with existing infrastructure.  because using saf in place of conventional jet fuel has the  potential to reduce lifecycle ghg emissions and doesn’t  require any modifications to infrastructure or aircraft, it’s crucial  to decarbonizing aviation. but we can’t do it on our own. our saf efforts we recognize the saf market faces scaling challenges. the  federal government has set an ambitious goal to scale up  domestic saf production to   billion gallons per year   by  .   replace for context,  .  million gallons of saf were produced in  the u.s. in  . reaching   billion gallons of saf by    would require a  % compound annual growth rate in saf  production between   and  . significant progress is  needed to hit these goals and requires government support  and collaboration across the entire aviation and saf value  chain. progress will depend on governments implementing  or extending policies and incentives (including tax credits)  to reduce the cost or incentivize production of saf; industry  standards, accounting protocols, or other applicable  requirements allowing the company to realize the benefits  from saf (including blend limitations); and other factors  outside of our control. planet        southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines

some examples of our saf initiatives and  how southwest helped move the needle in  .  neste we began using saf in our operations in january  . and in  august  , we became the first commercial airline to bring  saf to oakland international airport (oak). the saf used in  oak came from neste, a saf producer we began working with in  . oak is now the third commercial airport in the u.s.  to have saf incorporated into the daily operations of a major  airline.  according to neste, their saf is made from  % renewable  and sustainably sourced waste and residue raw materials, such  as cooking oil and animal waste fat, and it could reduce ghg  emissions by up to  %  over the fuel's lifecycle compared  with using conventional jet fuel. citizenship people performance planet governance frameworks

citizenship saffire in june  , we invested in saffire renewables, llc  (saffire ), a company formed by d max llc (d max), as  part of a doe-backed project to develop and produce scalable  saf. saffire is expected to utilize technology developed at  the doe's national renewable energy laboratory (nrel) to  convert corn stover, a widely available agricultural residue in  the u.s., into renewable ethanol that would then be upgraded  into saf. in  , the doe awarded d max a pilot-scale grant for  saf production, with a goal to scale technology that could  commercialize saf. according to nrel, this could produce  significant quantities of cost-competitive saf that could  provide up to an  % reduction in carbon intensity compared  with conventional jet fuel on a lifecycle basis. for southwest,  this was a first-of-its-kind investment into what we believe  could be potentially game-changing technology that could  help us reach our environmental sustainability goals. velocys as announced in november  , we entered into a    -year offtake agreement with velocys renewables llc  (velocys) for   million gallons of saf. in  , velocys  announced that their proposed facility, bayou fuels, was  re-optimized to improve the expected carbon intensity of  their saf to a negative carbon intensity of  –  gco e/mj  (previously –  gco e/mj) . with this update, according to  velocys, once blended with conventional jet fuel, the saf  could produce the equivalent of  .  billion gallons  of net  zero fuel and avoid   .   million metric tons of co  over the  term of the agreement.  additionally, as part of our offtake  agreement, southwest and velocys established a long-term  strategic relationship, offering us the opportunity to purchase  significant volumes of saf from future velocys facilities.marathon petroleum and phillips   we continue to work with marathon petroleum corporation  and phillips  . in  , we entered into memoranda  of understanding (mou) with these two leading energy  companies. the mous are intended to facilitate the  development and production of commercialized saf.  these collaborations may include a variety of initiatives, for  example, an increased focus on advocating saf policies with  governmental agencies, cooperation to advance research and  development targeted toward greater commercialization of  saf at progressively lower carbon intensities, and partnerships  on initiatives to raise public awareness of saf’s benefits. corporate saf beta program through our saf beta program, our valued corporate  customers played a key part in supporting our use of saf in  our operations. in  , we entered into saf beta agreements  that helped cover a significant portion of the premium over  conventional jet fuel for our saf deliveries.  in  , we also partnered with  air, an aviation sustainability  company providing consulting, documentation, and rating  services, to offer corporate customers in our saf beta  program independently verified assurance for scope    emission reduction rights associated with their support of  the use of saf in southwest’s operations. this partnership  provides an additional layer of transparency for our corporate  customers, helping them track their rights to certain scope    emission reductions. planet        southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines one report people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship our saf policy we developed and published a robust saf policy in   to  help guide our saf efforts. this policy will likely evolve over  time in this dynamic and developing industry.   economics:  we believe in democratizing the skies  through friendly, reliable, and low-cost air travel. to  continue to enable this as we seek to procure saf, saf  must be affordable compared to conventional jet fuel,  but today, saf is significantly more expensive than  conventional jet fuel. when we evaluate opportunities,  the parity of saf to jet a fuel is an important driver.   lifecycle ghg reduction: we require saf to meet a  minimum  % ghg intensity reduction on a lifecycle  basis compared to conventional jet fuel.  sustainability certification: we require saf to  be certified by an industry-accepted sustainability  certification scheme (scs), such as the international  sustainability and carbon certification (iscc) and the  roundtable on sustainable biomaterials (rsb).   exclusions: we won’t procure saf that contains palm  oil and its derivatives or by-products, such as palm fatty  acid distillates. saf must not contribute to deforestation  or forest degradation in its production.   feedstocks:  we encourage the development of  sustainable agriculture for crop-based feedstocks,  prioritize waste and residue and energy or cover crop  feedstocks, and engage in r&d with prospective  producers and partners focused on power to liquid  (ptl) technology. “introducing saf at oak is an exciting  moment in our environmental  sustainability journey at southwest  airlines, and it’s an honor to be the  first carrier to bring saf to oak. we’re  focused on bringing more saf into our  operations and are thrilled to partner

continue to be a part of  our multi-pronged environmental sustainability  strategy.  while we recognize that offsets have an  important role to play for our planet, we don’t plan  to use carbon offsets toward our voluntary near- term emissions intensity reduction targets and net  zero goal. future requirements to use offsets for  our international flying as part of corsia or from  other regulatory measures may arise .  in addition,  we may complement other environmental  initiatives with offset projects.   carbon offsets are tradeable rights generated from projects  that reduce, capture, or avoid a certain amount of emissions.  rights can be purchased from those projects to offset an equal amount of carbon emissions from other activities like flying.  we recognize that carbon offsets can be complex and that  there are differing perspectives on what makes a quality offset. planet        southwest airlines one report planet pb      southwest airlines one report people

proud to share that we’ve purchased offsets  equivalent to the carbon emissions generated by our  employee business  and charitable  travel for   through  a donation to carbonfund, a nonprofit that provides carbon  offsetting and ghg reduction options to individuals,  businesses, and organizations. the funds used to purchase the    offsets came from the southwest airlines foundation, a  fund facilitated by the silicon valley community foundation.  we have also purchased and retired additional offsets  equivalent to the carbon emissions from these categories  generated in  . we look for opportunities to engage with our individual  customers along our sustainability journey, and in  , we  continued our carbon offset offer.     additionally, in   we purchased renewable energy

with this  innovative group on decarbonizing aviation and advancing  critical science to support that objective. contrail impact task force we joined forces with academic, technology, nonprofit, and  airline partners to launch the contrail impact task force in   . the cross-sector task force was established to explore  the formation and mitigation of condensation trails, or  “contrails,” that might affect the climate impact of some flights.  rocky mountain institute (rmi) and breakthrough energy,  two clean-energy nonprofits, are spearheading the task force,  which met for the first time

extreme weather events that occurred in   and    alongside internal stakeholder interviews to understand  what impacts we are seeing today from severe weather  at the regional scale. our operations at times have been  adversely and materially impacted by severe weather,  such as winter storm elliott in december  . for more  information, see the risk factor in our   form  -k   which begins “ the

adverse weather or a localized  disaster or disturbance in a key geography has adversely and  materially impacted, and in the future could again adversely  and materially impact, the company’s business, results of  operations, and financial condition. our qualitative analysis of  potential climate-related impacts to our operations identified  significant short-term exposure risks for winter storms  and tropical storms only. while we are seeing some other  climate-related impacts today, our analysis did not identify  them as significant short-term risks. because these scenarios are subject to a number of assumptions and projections, we  cannot guarantee that this determination will not change or  that we will not experience increased short-term risks related  to our operations.   after we determined present day climate-related risks on a  regional scale, future potential risk exposure in the   and    time horizons were evaluated by projecting how climate  change may accelerate extreme weather impacts under  varying climate scenarios developed by the intergovernmental  panel on climate change (ipcc).                  two ipcc representative concentration pathway (rcp)  scenarios were applied to evaluate our future potential  exposure to physical climate-related risks. this set of  scenarios proposes different, potential climate futures. for  example, rcp .

net zero by    (nze) scenario and the stated policies (steps) scenario]   were used to evaluate potential climate-related transition  risks and opportunities in the mid- to long-term. together,  these scenarios map out the potential consequences of  different choices for energy use and energy security. the  steps scenario reflects current policy settings, as well as  policy initiatives under development. the nze scenario is a  normative iea scenario that shows a pathway for the global  energy sector to achieve net zero carbon emissions by  ,  with advanced economies reaching net zero

airport fees,  and supply chain disruptions may increase over time to  manage the damage of such events. increasing temperatures  and extreme heat waves pose an additional risk of revenue  loss from restricted capacity associated with aircraft weight  limits to account for the hotter, less dense air at some airports.    physical risk mitigation preparing for future weather events is a significant part of  our physical risk mitigation strategy. for example, we have  procedures and processes in place to manage weather events  as they occur, with tiered response programs based on the  severity of the event. given that our aircraft are mobile,  we are able to plan ahead and move those assets out of a  storm’s pathway as necessary to prevent avoidable physical  damage to our fleet. for weather-related disruptions, such as  winter storms, we continually strive to develop, follow, and  enhance operational processes and business management  procedures for proactive cancellation of flights in an attempt to manage any disruptions to our operations. we also strive  to appropriately staff the operation and determine when to  pause and restart our operations in the affected region.  we engage teams throughout our organization, as necessary,  to prepare for, respond to, and attempt to mitigate impacts  to our business from significant weather events. recognizing  the importance of weather-related planning, we’ve invested  greater resources into meteorology and network impact  analysis, expanding our meteorology staff in   and  growing our focus on weather events.   additionally, we collaborate with a wide range of key  stakeholders, such as the faa and airports, to evolve our  capacity and planning processes. by leveraging various  knowledge bases, expanding data sources, and using new  methods of air traffic management, we’re better equipped  to proactively respond to inclement weather, equipment  outages, and other factors that can cause delays and  cancellations.   we also evaluate and adjust our flight schedules on a regular  basis throughout the year, allowing for greater flexibility to  meet the needs of our customers and adapt to changing  conditions. to mitigate fuel-related disruptions from weather  events, such as floods and hurricanes, we closely monitor the  likelihood of disruptions to fuel supply; work to establish and  broaden our contacts with fuel trucking companies to obtain  priority access to trucks should refinery or pipeline supply  be interrupted; and regularly examine strategic reserves,  including an annual examination in advance of hurricane  season. our efforts to diversify our fuel supply, including the  expansion of saf within our fuel mix, are also intended to  further mitigate such disruptions in the long term. we also  engage in the more hazard-specific risk reduction strategies  detailed in the physical risks table on the following pages.  planet        southwest airlines one report planet

risk reduction strategiesshort- term present daymid- term  long- term   coastal floodingacutelarge-scale coastal flood events have the potential to impact transportation  infrastructure (e.g., roads, railroads), which could potentially cause fuel  supply disruptions and impact southwest customers’ and employees’ ability  to arrive at the airport. additionally, these impacts may lead to increases  in southwest’s operating expenses in the form of increased maintenance  or repair costs, insurance premiums, airport fees for repairs or other items,  or capital expenditures to replace damaged or waterlogged infrastructure.  smaller, less-developed airports located in areas exposed to coastal flooding  may struggle to adapt to increased incidences of coastal flood events. see physical risk mitigation  section for our comprehensive strategy,  which is applicable to coastal flooding. drought as the frequency and intensity of drought may increase, the possibility  of water restrictions caused by drought might impact airport and flight  operations. operating expenses may increase under drought conditions,  becoming more frequent as airport lease agreements may require increased  infrastructure enhancements for water conservation or include increased  water use fees. southwest might also experience medium-term to long-term impacts from  tourist destinations becoming less attractive in some areas. for example,  loss of snow in winter at ski destinations could impact revenues.at southwest, we understand the importance of water conservation.  although water consumption is a small part of our operations, it’s  an important natural resource, and we strive to take measures to  conserve water in our facilities and landscaping. the majority of our  water consumption comes from domestic use by our employees, and  we have implemented projects to target conservation in this area to  preserve this natural resource. extreme tropical storms tropical storms can potentially lead to aircraft being grounded for extended  periods, an issue that may be exacerbated due to interruptions in fuel  supply. this could lead to lost revenues due to cancellations and schedule  disruptions in affected areas and knock-on effects through the system.  operating expenses may increase in extreme tropical storm conditions,  with increased fuel expended to divert flights, increased maintenance, and  airport fees as clean-up and infrastructure upgrades may be increasingly  required in affected areas. insurance premiums may also rise over time, or  provide less coverage, with greater frequency and severity of events. for  capital infrastructure, investments may be required to replace hard assets  damaged by extreme storms, and asset values may be impaired due to  potential damage, such as to aircraft. employees may also be impacted by  such storms, which may impact their work availability as well as southwest's  employee support initiatives and costs. in addition to the overarching extreme weather response plan detailed  in the physical risk mitigation story, we also have a program to  help employees directly affected by weather-related events such as  hurricanes, supporting them and getting them back on their feet safely.  specifically, southwest employees may take advantage of a company- supported catastrophic assistance charity, which helps southwest  employees suffering from severe financial hardship resulting from a  catastrophic event in their lives. heat waves heat waves may affect labor productivity, increase cooling costs, and affect  aircraft performance. southwest’s ground crews are on the tarmac for  prolonged periods, potentially leaving them exposed to the effects of heat  waves. potential increases in heat wave incidence, duration, intensity, and  the length of the season may increase cooling costs. tarmac and airplane  repair costs may increase as prolonged exposure to heat may expedite the  usual wear of assets. heat waves may also affect aircraft performance and  could decrease revenues due to reduced flight payloads and more baggage  restrictions necessitated by weight limits imposed by heat. additionally,  related costs may increase, such as fuel. as heat makes the air less dense,  aircraft must exert more thrust to produce enough lift for takeoff. in the long  term, capital investment in new aircraft or parts may be necessary for greater  resilience and greater operational functionality in higher temperatures.to mitigate weather-related risks to our employees, especially those  such as heat impacts, we provide appropriate personal protective  equipment and resources. we have implemented health and safety  procedures and policies, and we monitor compliance with such policies  and evaluate them for relevance. for more information about our  safety program, please refer to the management approach to safety .climate-related physical risks exposure to impacts:  low med high

people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship inland floodingacuteextreme precipitation might lead to inland flooding and could create  operational challenges for southwest. flooding could damage the airport  runway and infrastructure, making it unsafe for aircraft to take off and  land. this could in turn lead to flight delays and cancellations, impacting  revenues. inland flooding could additionally affect nearby transportation  infrastructure and potentially disrupt fuel supply chains. inland flooding  could impact southwest’s employees' and customers' ability to travel to and  from the airport.we integrate resiliency into our building design plans for owned  ancillary buildings, including hangars, incorporating considerations  of the  -year flood, large hailstorms, and lightning into the design  process. storm systems are designed for  -year flood and buildings  are typically set at a higher elevation to help prevent flooding.  wildfires extreme wildfires can rapidly change conditions such as visibility and wind  speeds that affect air travel. in the event of a spreading wildfire, flights may  either be delayed, re-routed, or canceled entirely depending on the severity  of the wildfire, leading to potential lost revenues and potential knock-on  effects throughout the system. employees working at certain outdoor  locations may be impacted by harmful air quality conditions in the event  of a nearby wildfire. operating expenses may also increase due to wildfire  conditions in the form of increased maintenance costs for aircraft engines  with severe smoke or ash exposure or increased fuel expenses to re-route  around affected areas. aircraft assets damaged by smoke or ash may require  accelerated depreciation, reducing earnings in the year of recognition or  reducing the residual asset value of the damaged aircraft asset.in  , we implemented changes to wildfire monitoring procedures  to require outdoor personnel in certain states to be provided masks  should wildfire smoke become a hazard, based on a parts per million  threshold. those values are monitored locally by ground operations  personnel with assistance and support from the meteorology team.  monitoring occurs across   stations covering california and the  western states. winter storms & cold snaps snowstorms can create multiple challenges to airline operations: the safety  of aircraft, environmental compliance of deicing equipment and wastewater,  which adds operating costs, and disruption to ground transportation and  flights that could lead to lost revenue due to cancellations and schedule  disruptions in affected areas, with potential follow-on effects through the  system. such impacts may also increase operating costs in the form of  premium pay and rerouting of employees to staff the operation. extreme  winter storms and cold snaps can also affect transportation infrastructure  and lead to damage of equipment and supply chain interruptions. aircraft  assets damaged by extreme cold or winter weather, such as hail, may require  accelerated depreciation, reducing earnings in the year of recognition and/ or reducing the residual asset value of the aircraft asset. various capital  investments in order to mitigate risks and impacts from weather-related  events may also become necessary, including as discussed in the next  paragraph regarding winter storm elliot.in late december  , we experienced winter storm elliot. after  this winter weather event, we implemented a plan to increase our  existing winter operational resiliency. this plan includes increasing the  number of available deicing trucks and ground equipment; procuring  additional deicing pads and increasing glycol capacity at key locations;  implementing new weather applications to enhance deicing holdover  times; purchasing and deploying additional engine covers and heaters;  and augmenting winter staffing levels.climate-related physical

pb      southwest airlines one report people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship chronicincreasing temperatures as the annual average temperature may increase over time in the u.s.,  additional cooling costs might be needed. in some airports, the restriction  on takeoff weight due to hot air might also become a chronic issue that  limits southwest's ability to transport passengers and cargo. reduced  available seat miles and load factors due to decreased payloads might  impact revenues. increased fuel usage and associated costs may be  necessary to gain the same lift in hot conditions, and airport fees may  increase to adapt infrastructure to these chronic weather changes, such  as by extending runway length and resilience to heat. in the longer-term  horizon, capital expenditures may increase to invest in and replace fixed  or other ground assets vulnerable to heat, such as new components more  resilient and operationally suited to higher temperatures.through network planning, we can avoid routing aircraft to areas  that are more prone to takeoff load restrictions during the hottest  times of the day. this provides an opportunity to mitigate such takeoff  restrictions though planning efforts in the long term. additionally, we  can consider changed climate conditions in long-term travel demand  forecasts, especially given the regional scenario analysis conducted  within this scope of work.  changes in precipitation na as extreme precipitation may increase in all regions, this could impact  southwest customers’ and employees’ ability to commute and travel to and  from the airport. it may also cause flight delays. continuous exposure to  extreme precipitation could additionally impact hard assets not designed or  engineered to withstand frequent, intense precipitation, resulting in higher  expenditures in insurance premiums, investments in flood defenses, and  increased airport fees to develop resilience upgrades to mitigate  these impacts.we aim to continue to work alongside the airports and local airport  authorities within our network to address contingency plans and  flood preparedness. in terms of building design, including our owned  ancillary buildings and hangars, storm systems are designed for  - year flood and buildings are typically set at a higher elevation to help  prevent flooding. climate-related transition risks and  opportunities assessment southwest also performed a tcfd-informed qualitative  scenario analysis to identify potential risks and business  opportunities that may arise by transitioning toward a low- carbon economy. the scenario analysis explored a variety  of potential risks, including the potential market impact  of changing customer behavior, the increased cost of raw  materials, policy and legal risks around regulations and  enhanced emissions and climate reporting obligations, as well  as reputation and technology-related risks.  southwest’s climate-related transition risks were generally  the greatest under the nze by   scenario, increasing from  present-day through  . risks that may pose the greatest  potential impact centered around projected impacts of regular  jet fuel and other supply chain raw material inputs, as well as assumptions around the saf market that may not come  to fruition. such risks could impact southwest’s ability to  achieve its climate goals, including carbon emissions intensity  reduction of  % by   and  % by   (as compared with   ),  replacing  % of total jet fuel consumption with saf by   , and net zero by  .    our scenario analysis focused on potential risks and  opportunities that may arise along our path to net zero.   for example, using more fuel-efficient technologies for fleet  operations could reduce our financial exposure to fossil fuel  cost increases and volatility. if southwest can successfully  meet our climate goals and communicate such progress  accordingly, we may attract new customers and generate  additional revenue.  climate-related physical risks exposure to impacts:  low med high potential mid- to long-term impacts risk reduction strategiesshort- term present daymid- term  long- term   planet

climate change  may mean some customers choose to fly less frequently or  fly on an airline they perceive as operating in a manner that’s  more sustainable. customers may increasingly choose to use  alternatives to travel, such as virtual meetings and workspaces.  further development of high-speed rail or autonomous electric  vehicles in markets now served by short-haul flights could  provide passengers with lower-carbon alternatives to flying.  the company’s collateral to secure loans, including in the  form of aircraft, could lose value as customer demand shifts  and economies move to low-carbon alternatives, which may  increase the company’s financing costs. as leisure destinations  such as snow and tropical destinations face greater frequency  and severity of acute and chronic physical events, there may  be a change in demand for leisure travel or destinations of  choice for such travel, potentially reducing revenues in current  markets.we recognize the importance for the aviation industry to address its environmental  impact. as a hard to abate sector, we know there are challenges in achieving this  goal. a truly collaborative journey lies ahead, and southwest remains focused on  doing its part. in  , we proudly announced long-term and near-term goals and  a  -year environmental sustainability plan, all of which we recently refreshed.  throughout  , we’ve taken important steps toward achieving these goals  through, for example, our saf offtake agreements, our first-of-its-kind investment in  saffire, and our fleet modernization and fuel efficiency initiatives. to stay informed of customer expectations, we routinely leverage trip net promoter  surveys, re-evaluate and adjust network plans, and provide products and services  to adjust more rapidly to leisure and business travel demand. for example, we have   launched a carbon offset offer for individual travelers.  we’ve also engaged with  some of our corporate customers on saf beta partnerships that support southwest’s  utilization of available, qualifying saf in its operation. through our saf beta  program, our corporate customers have the opportunity to purchase certain scope    emissions reductions rights. we also launched the green incentive program, a  southwest business performance-based incentive program that provides eligible  corporate customers the opportunity to earn and use funds for their company's  sustainability initiatives. increased cost of raw materials steps operating costs, such as fossil fuel, may be high or increase  over time if global fuel production decreases due to supply  chain disruptions or increased regulations such as carbon  pricing. there may be additional financing costs to hedge  exposure to volatile prices.southwest attempts to manage its risk associated with volatile jet fuel prices by  utilizing over-the-counter fuel derivative instruments to hedge a portion of its future  jet fuel purchases. in addition, we continue to make long-term investments, such as  our fleet modernization program, which helps our operations be more fuel efficient.  in  , fuel-saving initiatives estimated saving more than   million gallons of jet  fuel, and fuel efficiency (measured in asms per gallon) increased by  % compared  with   levels.  additionally, our efforts to diversify fuel supply, including through  expansion of saf within our fuel mix, is also intended to further mitigate such cost  volatility—assuming saf is cost-competitive and less volatile in comparison. policy and legalenhanced emissions and climate reporting obligations nze the company is subject to federal, state, local, and international  laws and regulations relating to the protection of the  environment. federal, state, local, and international legislative  and regulatory bodies are generally increasingly focused on  climate change and reducing ghg emissions, including co   emissions. for example, the united nations’ international  civil aviation organization (icao) has implemented its   corsia program, which seeks to cap carbon emissions from  international civil aviation at  % of   levels from  - .we actively monitor emerging regulations and analyze the risks to our business,  including engaging with regulators and industry associations such as airlines for  america (a a) and icao to advocate for reasonable and responsible climate policy. as part of corsia, we monitor our international emissions for reporting purposes.  we seek to mitigate these obligations through initiatives such as fuel-saving  programs and efforts to increase our supply of saf. we report our scope  ,   scope  , and certain scope   emissions and progress towards our climate goals in  our one report and cdp climate change questionnaire. mandates on and regulation of existing products and services nze future policy, legal, regulatory, or other market developments  could require southwest to reduce its emissions, modify its  supply chain practices or aspects of its operations, make capital  investments to purchase specific types of equipment, software,  or technologies to meet reporting requirements, secure carbon  offset credits or saf due to increased obligations, or otherwise  incur additional costs related to climate objectives, such as  increased reporting and regulatory requirements resulting in  increased labor and professional services fees.we engage with regulators and industry associations such as a a and icao to  advocate for reasonable and responsible climate policy. our governmental affairs  department

could be adversely impacted  by, among other things, (i) any failure to meet its sustainability  or esg plans or goals, including those that relate to climate  change; (ii) the company’s impact on the environment; or   (iii) public pressure from investors or policy groups to change  southwest’s policies related to the environment. to the extent  that the company is unable to respond timely and appropriately  to negative publicity, southwest’s reputation and brand can be  harmed. damage to our overall reputation and brand could  negatively impact its financial results and require additional  resources for the company to rebuild its reputation. major  financial institutions have begun to announce ghg reduction  targets for their financed activities in the aviation sector. to the  extent that the company's climate targets are not perceived to  align with those of its lenders, the company's access to credit  may be adversely impacted.southwest operates one of the world's most admired and awarded airlines, and we  take pride in our reputation as the airline with heart. famous for an employee-first  corporate culture, southwest maintains an unprecedented record of no involuntary  furloughs or layoffs in its history. our formula for success brought industry-leading  prosperity and   consecutive years of profitability for southwest shareholders  through   (nyse: luv). to address any potential stakeholder concerns, we frequently engage with our  stakeholders regarding our sustainability efforts through investor calls, individual  meetings with corporate customers, financial partner engagements, and through  our communications and outreach. we also measure consumer and employee  sentiment for public posts and press releases related to sustainability published  on our channels, and we utilize a quarterly report that monitors our reputation  externally and provides insight on a variety of topics, including esg. we work to maintain our reputation and brand by setting long-term and near-term  sustainability goals, and we’re taking steps toward achieving these goals through  initiatives like saf offtake agreements and fuel efficiency efforts. we’ll continue  to make long-term investments, such as our fleet modernization program, which  improves fuel efficiency and helps us achieve our climate goals. technologysaf value chain steps as southwest’s climate goals are dependent on the scaling of  the saf market, we’re inherently reliant on numerous factors to  achieve these goals, including: the implementation or extension  of saf government incentives and the performance of third- party saf producers. any non-performance of such third parties  or lack of appropriate incentives and infrastructure for saf  could cause the company not to achieve its sustainability goals,  increase the company’s costs associated with meeting such  goals, or adversely impact the company’s reputation or brand.saf plays an important role in our depicted path to net zero by  . by  , we  plan to replace  % of our total jet fuel consumption with saf; however, we cannot  guarantee that our saf efforts will be successful or ultimately allow us to meet our  goal. in  , we invested in saffire renewables, llc. saffire is expected to  utilize technology developed at the department of energy’s national renewable  energy laboratory to convert corn stover, a widely available agricultural residue in  the u.s., into renewable ethanol that would then be upgraded into saf. in addition,  as of december  ,  , we’ve secured offtake agreements with neste and velocys,  and entered into memorandums of understanding with marathon petroleum  corporation and phillips   with the intention to facilitate the development and  production of commercialized saf. additionally, in  , we participated in the saf  blender’s tax credit coalition, a broad partnership of aviation industry stakeholders  who support new long-term tax incentives for saf. ultimately, the coalition achieved  its goals by helping to support the inclusion of important saf tax credit incentives  within the inflation reduction act, which passed in august  . transitioning to lower emissions aircraft technology nze southwest is reliant on max aircraft deliveries from the  boeing company (boeing) to meet our climate goals. with the  emerging focus and advancement of new aircraft technologies,  including electric and hydrogen, there may be opportunities  for investment in the future. such investments could result  in increased operating expenses in the form of research &  development into new fuels and technologies and the potential  for sunk costs if certain technologies aren’t widely accepted,  commercialized, or become obsolete quickly.we plan to continue to modernize our fleet with more fuel-efficient boeing    max aircraft.  the   max, powered by cfm international leap- b engines,  includes design updates such as boeing’s advanced technology winglet, which  results in less drag and further optimizes the   max’s performance, especially on  longer-range flights. as saf is currently recognized as the element that will play the most critical role  in decarbonizing the aviation sector by  , we are focusing our strategy on saf  for the time being. additionally, as a fully certified drop-in fuel when blended with  conventional jet fuel in accordance with industry standards, saf is compatible with  existing infrastructure, making saf lower risk than novel propulsion technologies. we’ve taken action toward our saf goals with our investment in saffire, offtake  agreements

acquisition and  integration of airtran airways, the development of the new  southwest.com e-commerce platform, or any of the numerous  transformational projects he’s led, bob has built a track record  for inspiring our teams to achieve big things. bob’s first year as  ceo was no different.  bob jordan’s  first year as ceo bob kicked off his first year as ceo by sharing with employees  his “blueprint for success”—a set of five strategic priorities  designed to set the company’s course for the next five years.  as southwest continued to recover from the pandemic, bob  rallied our teams around the principle of getting back to  basics and leaning on the southwest way values that have  always helped southwest stand apart.  to inspire action and progress, bob and his executive  leadership team aligned our five strategic priorities to key  company focus areas and measurable company goals and  launched a companywide southwest airlines gratitude  (swag) incentive program to recognize our employees  throughout the year for their continuous efforts toward  achieving them. during his first year as ceo, bob led southwest through the  largest hiring sprint in our company’s history. we ended the  year hiring more than  ,  new employees, with the vast  majority hired into operational roles.  governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship and when nearly one-fifth of your workforce is new,  leadership matters. bob worked tirelessly with cross- functional teams to maintain our exceptional standards for  recruitment, hiring, and training. with southwest still emerging from pandemic challenges and  working through the hiring surge, bob’s leadership helped the  company stay laser-focused on our most important asset—our  people. bob prioritized programs designed to make our new  hires felt welcomed to our team. programs like wingmate,  which pair new hires up with experienced southwest  employees, and sending welcome boxes to new hires’  homes made our new employees feel welcomed, cared for,  and appreciated. we also continued to invest in our union- represented employees by working hard to reach contract  agreements. in  , southwest ratified new agreements with  our appearance technicians and customer service employees.  as of march  ,  , we have also ratified new agreements for  our flight instructors, facilities maintenance technicians, and  dispatchers, and we remain focused on closing negotiations  with all open groups as swiftly as possible. southwest also prioritized talent and leadership development  throughout  , investing in initiatives to create and enhance  meaningful learning and development programs to support  our people and their careers. our high impact development  portfolio, mentorship program, and the return of our  leadership summit in   are all strong examples of our  ongoing commitment to the development of our people.   bob’s leadership in getting southwest properly staffed created  a foundation for ongoing improvements in stabilizing and  restoring our network. throughout  , we improved our  schedule quality by adding more depth and more nonstop  flights, adding short-haul flights in business markets, and  more flying across our crew bases. while our efforts toward improving our operations in    are worth celebrating, we must also acknowledge the  operational disruptions that occurred in late december  .  as bob shared with employees and customers, we recognize  the hardships this situation caused so many. following the  disruption, we performed internal reviews and assessments,  and also engaged a third-party global aviation firm, oliver  wyman, for a third-party assessment. we have developed  a tactical action plan to boost operational resiliency and  significantly reduce the likelihood of repeating an event of  that magnitude and impact. we are primarily focused in three areas. our first focus area is improving winter operations,  which focuses on airport infrastructure, equipment, and winter  preparedness. our second focus area is enhancing cross-team  collaboration, which focuses on our processes, decision- making, escalation procedures, and communication during  irregular operations. our third focus area is accelerating other  investments, which includes technology and tools that allow  for greater volume and pace during irregular operations. the  experience reaffirmed our commitment to having the right  people, tools, technology, and processes in place to deliver the  exceptional service our customers have come to expect from  us over the decades .  we remain focused on investing in tools to help us streamline  our operations moving forward. in  , for example, we  implemented electronic shift trading for ground operations  employees and a new hotel booking system to procure hotel  rooms for crew members—all with the goal of making it easier  for our employees to focus on getting the job done. we also  began setting a framework that we believe will enable us to  move to a paperless aircraft turn, which remains a focus in   . together, these efforts helped us gain momentum in  improving our on-time performance (otp), building on our  legendary hospitality, and delivering an unparalleled and  modernized customer and employee experience.  a big part of getting the basics right is keeping costs low so  we can keep fares low. it’s crucial to our business model and  has been part of southwest's dna and our success since day  one. amidst cost inflation and recession concerns, southwest  stayed vigilant about controlling costs, working efficiently, and  taking care of each other and our customers.  bob remains extremely proud of the progress southwest made  getting back to basics in  . perhaps even more important  to him, though, is the way we achieved these things—together.  he often says the best part of his work week is being with our  people, and being invigorated by their enthusiasm, optimism,  and honest feedback. throughout the year, bob visited more  than   locations and dropped in on countless training classes,  new hire breakfasts and lunches, captain upgrade classes,  and many more important company moments. no matter  where he goes or who he talks to, one of the loudest themes  he hears is to be one team supporting each other and serving  our customers. and we see that happening as the business  stabilizes, our results improve, and we continue to invest in  our people. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship in  , ceo bob jordan introduced

industry has historically been volatile and subject  to various operational and financial challenges. successful  identification and mitigation of risks, along with having  appropriate response mechanisms in place to quickly address  rapidly emerging events, are essential for our continued  viability and success in maintaining a resilient brand for our  customers and employees.    southwest’s enterprise risk management (erm) team plays  an important role in managing existing and emerging risks  that are critical to the overall business goals and objectives  of our company. the erm team conducts risk assessments,  produces internal reports, defines risk focus areas, and  provides a framework to drive cross-departmental alignment.  climate-related risks are integrated into this multi-disciplinary companywide erm process. as part of this, the erm team  oversees a tiered risk management structure including risk  champions, comprised of subject matter experts from key  departments, risk owners comprised of senior leaders, and a  risk committee of executive leadership. the erm team meets  with risk champions and risk owners on a quarterly and as  needed basis to identify, evaluate, document, prioritize, and  score risks for impact, vulnerability, likelihood, and velocity.  the erm team and risk champions work together to craft  a risk statement, document other qualifying information,  develop risk reduction plans, and begin tracking the risks and  progress towards mitigation. all risks and mitigation strategies  are tracked, and critical risks are escalated to the risk  committee. the risk committee meets quarterly to review risk  status and mitigation and validate appropriate actions are in  place. the president & ceo has accountability and oversight of  the risk committee and erm function.    in addition to the erm team, the southwest emergency  response and business continuity teams oversee planning  and response initiatives to meet

standards and technology (nist) cybersecurity framework  to enable data, system, and application security in all areas  of our business. this is a risk-based approach to mitigate  organizational cybersecurity risks and impacts to southwest’s  facilities, airports, and aircraft. the nist cybersecurity  framework helps us understand, manage, and reduce  cybersecurity risks and apply the outputs of the framework  to help inform the cybersecurity agenda. southwest also  has a dedicated cybersecurity team, made up of engineers,  analysts, and leaders, as part of our technology department.  the team maintains our cybersecurity products, processes,  procedures, and operations and conducts vulnerability  management and penetration testing to identify, classify,  prioritize, remediate, and mitigate vulnerabilities. the team  also manages and executes the company’s cybersecurity  incident response plan to prepare for and respond to a  cybersecurity incident. the plan is tested yearly via a tabletop  exercise to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities  for change. vulnerability management, penetration testing,  and cybersecurity incidents are tracked via a platform that  helps our organization meet internal service level   agreement goals.  to stay on top of emerging cyber threats and upcoming cyber  regulations, southwest is proudly a founding member of the  aviation information sharing and analysis center (a-isac)  and a member of the airlines for america cybersecurity  council. we also subscribe to multiple cybersecurity threat  intelligence feeds to monitor the

to our cybersecurity policies, which are  outlined in guidelines for employees, our employee policy  handbook, and are acknowledged annually. educating  our employees on cybersecurity doesn’t just stop with our  policy acknowledgments. southwest leverages multiple  communication strategies and channels to interact with and  educate employees. for example, in recognition of national  cybersecurity awareness month in october, southwest  conducts an annual communication campaign to educate  employees on topics like phishing, social engineering,  working securely in a remote environment, and password  security. throughout the year, we also have a regular cadence  of reminders and messaging about the importance   of cybersecurity. data privacy southwest’s business requires us to process, store, and  sometimes share the personal information of our customers,  people, and partners. our privacy program is based on a broad  set of privacy principles and applicable law. while our privacy  office is responsible for the day-to-day management and  oversight of our program, we believe that privacy is everyone’s  responsibility and have approximately   volunteers or  appointed privacy champions embedded throughout the  company that go through additional privacy training. this  training, supported by relevant internal policies and applicable  law, not only educates, but creates broad awareness of the  appropriate standards and controls required throughout  the lifecycle of the data. the privacy champions work with  the privacy office to operationalize the privacy program in a  scalable fashion. southwest offers data privacy training courses  for all employees through southwest airlines university.  employees can enroll in classes such as “privacy at southwest”  and “privacy by design” to learn how to identify or report  potential data privacy incidents and embed privacy controls  throughout the data lifecycle. as part of our implementation  and maintenance of the privacy program, varying elements  of the privacy program are audited by our internal audit  department. the privacy office and the associate general  counsel, information governance report to our chief legal  and regulatory officer.   to learn more about how we process personal information,  our privacy policy  is available on southwest.com. supply chain disruption as with many industries, southwest continued to experience  the effects of the pandemic’s global impact on supply chains.  the supply chain ecosystem was disrupted by new and  unforeseen barriers which caused a number of challenges  for our supply chain team. from record-long lead times,  wide-scale shortages of materials, rising commodities prices,  and difficulties in transporting products across countries, our  supply chain team mastered each challenge while partnering  with current and newly identified suppliers.    as southwest ramped up the operation in response to  customer demand in  , demand forecasting added a new  layer of complexity. scarcity in raw materials translated into  cost increases and lower production levels which resulted in  modifications to a few of our onboard customer experience  offerings and employee-related support functions. examples  of shortages we experienced included onboard service  products and employee uniforms. governance        southwest

southwest’s vision is to be the world’s most loved, most  efficient, and most profitable airline. this is achieved through  the outstanding work of all our employees to consistently  deliver outstanding hospitality at a low cost to our customers.   in order to keep our costs low, we use a proven strategic sourcing  methodology that includes cross-functional teams to regularly  re-evaluate programs, conduct market research, and facilitate  competitive bidding. we value suppliers who can increase our  productivity and quality while improving our processes and  services. our unique workforce has encouraged innovative  business solutions and leveraged our competitive advantage  to establish southwest airlines as a leader in our industry.  as a company, we value diversity and seek to create an  environment that encourages it, both in the workplace and  among our supplier base. with this in mind, our supplier  diversity program was designed to enable southwest to  extend opportunities to qualified small, small disadvantaged,  hubzone, minority, women, veteran, disabled, and lesbian,  gay, bisexual, and/or transgender businesses (small/diverse  businesses), who in turn can help southwest fulfill its  operational needs, satisfy the expectations of our shareholders  and customers, and meet current and future competitive  business challenges.  we understand the powerful impact southwest has in the  markets we operate, which is why we give from the heart. we  strive to make a positive difference by virtue of our outreach  initiatives and community engagement. our corporate  commitment to supplier diversity outlines the importance  of fostering an environment that moves us forward and  recognizes and values the collaboration of diverse thoughts,  backgrounds, and experiences. as a prime contractor to the  federal government and in partnership with the general  services administration, southwest established annual small  business goals and surpassed each of the six subcategory  goals in  . additionally, in early  , we published our supplier code  of conduct and began integrating sustainability questions in  our request for proposal (rfp) process. these rfp questions  are an important step in engaging with our suppliers on their  sustainability initiatives.as outlined in our procurement policy for employees,  all suppliers are treated fairly and impartially during the  evaluation and selection process. we use more than one  selection process, depending on company requirements and  supply market conditions. each selection process is focused  on the most efficient way to achieve the same results and the  best value combination of quality, reliability, fit for purpose,  and service for southwest at the lowest total cost. compliance  with the policy allows us to spend our money wisely, improve  contract adherence, and protect southwest from undue risk.  in support of connecting people to what’s important in their  lives, we seek to maintain our low-cost leadership through  effective and efficient procurement practices and spending  our valuable capital wisely. public policy, regulation, & transparency legislative and regulatory actions have the potential to  expand or limit southwest’s growth opportunities. in  addition, government policies, including new legislation  and regulations and the enforcement of existing regulations,  can have a profound impact on how we do business. our  governmental affairs department works to stay on top of  proposed statutory and regulatory changes to directly educate  a wide range of policymakers and stakeholder groups. we also  present our views on these topics through trade associations,  business forums, chamber organizations, and interactions  with public officials at the federal level and in the states and  communities we serve.   one trade association in which we participate is airlines for  america (a a), which allows us to gain insight into core issues  for the airline industry and to advocate jointly for regulations  that support a healthy, competitive industry. we also benefit  from the opportunity to share technical expertise and

however, in all cases, that portion was not more  than $ ,   annually for each organization. regarding climate change, our advocacy in this regard is  focused on southwest achieving our goal for net zero carbon  emissions by   and our new   carbon intensity  reduction goal, which is based on scientific models  that are in  alignment with the goals of the paris agreement. whether it  is working through a a or partnering with other stakeholders  who share our climate-related priorities, it is critically  important for southwest to advocate for governmental policies  and programs that will result in southwest flying more fuel- efficiently and using more saf. to achieve net zero carbon  emissions by  , we need the government’s assistance  to enable greater advances related to air traffic control  modernization, new types of aircraft and ground support  equipment, and scaling-up and deploying saf. political contributions southwest has adopted a policy that it will primarily use its  affiliated political action committee, the southwest airlines co.  freedom fund (“freedom fund”), financed by contributions  made voluntarily by employees, to support political  campaigns. company funds are limited to supporting selected  political campaigns at the state and local level in compliance  with the laws of the relevant states and localities.   we hold in high regard the responsibility of managing the  freedom fund and being good stewards of our employees’  hard-earned dollars. we have a time-tested evaluation process  when considering freedom fund contribution requests, and  we evaluate our criteria for giving annually. additionally, the  criteria, as well as all political campaign contributions from the  freedom fund or by the company directly, are approved by  the senior vice president governmental affairs and real estate  and overseen by southwest’s chief legal and regulatory  officer, with an annual summary of those contributions  provided to the southwest board of directors. we intend  for all political contributions to promote company interests  and are not guided by any private political preferences of  any employee. we disclose all contributions by the freedom  fund via publicly available reports filed monthly with the  federal election commission. the company strives to comply  with all applicable federal, state, and local campaign finance  restrictions and disclosure requirements. in  , contributions from the freedom fund totaled  $ ,   to political committees at the federal level and  $ ,   to political committees at the state and local levels.  moreover, the company contributed $ ,   directly to state  and/or local political campaigns in  six states  (california, florida,  hawaii, illinois, maryland, and nevada). in  , the company  did not support or finance any state or local ballot measure  before voters. at the federal level, no company funds were  used to support or finance any political campaign, nor did the  company support or finance any so-called “super pacs” or  any political committees organized under section   of the  internal revenue code. the company made no contributions  to a politically affiliated  (c)( ) organization in  . diversity, equity, & inclusion recognizing, respecting, and valuing differences is at the core  of who we are at southwest and encompasses our approach  to dei. our employees bring their own talents, creativity, and  individuality with them when they come to work each day,  and we foster a culture of caring that values these differences.  since  , belonging and inclusion has always been at the  heart of southwest airlines, utilizing diversity of thought and  experience. as the underdog creating a new way to fly, we  needed everyone’s point-of-view to succeed.    known for putting people first, southwest is dedicated to  advancing our dei journey to cultivate a workforce and  leadership team that reflects the diverse communities we  serve. we support learning and development efforts that are  democratized and inclusive of various career growth paths and  equal opportunity for those interested in such career growth.  our dei vision is to cultivate a diverse and inclusive workplace  experience for all our people to thrive—employees, customers,  and partners.   at southwest airlines, our heart represents our identity.  it’s more than the symbol of our brand. it’s who we are.  we’re a company of people. people representing diversity  of culture, background, experiences, and viewpoints. each  of our employees bring their own talents, creativity, and  individuality. and together, we make southwest the incredible  company it is. our people are the heart of southwest airlines.  southwest’s story of inclusion is founded on access, unity, and  acceptance. we truly believe that it takes every single of one  us to build diverse, equitable, and inclusive experiences. we  understand that in order for every employee at southwest to  thrive, we must foster an environment of impartiality, fairness,  representation, and balance. we’re committed to being a  place where employees feel welcomed and encouraged to  bring their whole selves to work without fear of hate, racism,  discrimination, harassment, intolerance, disrespect, or injustice.  governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines

●championing the enterprise dei vision    ● leading strong communication efforts to build shared  language, meaning, and understanding    ● managing dei as a valued strategy    ● tracking and assessing progress and improvements    ● reporting to the board of directors and executive leaders    ● championing informal and formal conversations  and perspectives on southwest’s dei vision with a  particular focus on talent, culture and values, brand and  reputation, and communication we’re committed to listening to our people—employees and  customers—and doing our part to drive meaningful change,  both inside and outside the company. we’re also dedicated  to working alongside our diverse suppliers and community  partners to champion dei in the communities we serve.  like many other companies, we’re on a journey, and we  recognize that there’s always more we can do to make our  work environment even better, even more accepting. we’re  committed to enhancing our dei efforts with a particular  focus in the areas of talent, culture and values, brand and  reputation, and communication. in order to reach our goals  and aspirations, we must allow for vulnerability, engage in  courageous conversations, and listen to our employees,  customers, and communities.    as we continue on this journey to advance dei, we use key  performance indicators (kpis) to track success of these efforts,  such as:    ●employee surveys     ● employee self-id data   ● completion of dei training and education    ● retention, recruiting, and promotion metrics  in september  , southwest announced company goals  to strengthen and improve efforts to create more diverse,  equitable, and inclusive job opportunities and candidate  pipelines while championing a welcoming environment for  all employees. since  , we increased the racial diversity of  our senior management committee (smc) by two percentage  points. today, we are making steady progress to increase racial  and gender diversity in leadership. additional information  regarding our senior leadership is available in the   dei  report. the dei department formed an executive steering  committee to support the strategic direction of this progress.  additional strides include evolving the company's talent  acquisition processes by requiring diverse candidate slates for  new, open leadership positions (vice presidents and below),  inclusion training for all hiring leaders, and the creation  of a center of excellence (coe). we are currently working  with our community partners in support of our efforts to  continue developing diverse and inclusive talent pipelines and  expanding recruiting efforts. in  , we launched an internal  dei employee resource website, created an allyship guide,  and introduced the ability for employees to develop diversity- focused groups. we launched an inclusive leadership guide  in  . in  , we launched our dei narrative “every. single. one. of.  us.” which highlights what dei means at southwest and our  commitment to each and every employee. we also launched  new inclusion wearables, inclusive of pronoun pins that give  employees the option to express their gender identities.  additionally, we opened up membership to our diversity  council, doubling our intake to   members. finally, we  launched our very first dei report—a companion piece to the  one

governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship looking ahead, we seek to continue building a solid  foundation and cultivate shared understanding among all  employees. our goal is to launch a self-id campaign to fully  capture our diverse landscape. in early  , we formalized  our employee resource group (erg) program connected to  our cultural, heritage, and pride months to provide networking  and professional development opportunities for employees.  the purpose of our dei initiatives is to empower employees  to explore, educate, and further connect in the dei space.  southwest's motivation is to continue being a healthy  organization where employees thrive, feel appreciated, valued,  and have an authentic sense of belonging.   we offer resources for employees to safely report if other  employees are not aligning with our company values. we’re  committed to our dei mission and vision, and we don’t  tolerate discrimination, bullying, retaliation, or harassment.  as we move forward, we strive to understand our progress  toward our goals. listening to our stakeholders—employees,  customers, communities, and shareholders—is a priority  and is vital to our dei growth as it helps us identify areas of  strength and opportunity. employee retention & recruitment  southwest seeks to provide a stable work environment  with equal opportunities for learning and personal growth.  we focus on bringing the best people into the southwest  family—those who share our company values, and providing  a competitive total rewards package, on-the-job training, and  resources to help employees succeed.     finding and retaining top talent is key to our ongoing success.  we strive to offer candidates the best hiring experience,  and part of that focus means transparency at every step. we  continue streamlining our hiring and employment screening  processes to onboard new southwest cohearts more quickly  and efficiently by automating steps in our hiring process,  hosting info sessions and webinars for prospective candidates,  and incorporating remote interview opportunities. each  candidate receives our famous southwest hospitality.    referral program  we know southwest employees provide a tremendous  resource that allows us to recruit individuals who naturally  display our company values, invigorate our culture, and show  interest in employment with southwest. we’ve invested in an  employee referral incentive program to reward employees for  submitting quality referrals who are hired into the company  and stay at least six months. hiring events  we returned to in-person hiring events for select high- volume markets and roles in  . this approach enabled  us to interact with candidates, complete an interview, make  contingent job offers, and begin the initial employment  screening process on the same day. additionally, we  partnered with several nonprofit organizations focused on  dei in historically underrepresented workgroups to attract  great candidates. we sponsored and attended hiring events  [e.g., women in aviation, organization of black aerospace  professionals (obap), etc.] and hosted tour days for pipeline  programs, like obap aerospace career education (ace)  academy, to impact the pipeline of the future. we invest  in recruiting and retention efforts and building pipelines  for future talent to enable continued competitiveness in  the market. after reviewing the various roles available at  southwest, we recognized that many don’t require a college  degree for an employee to be successful. as a result, we  removed “degree preferred” verbiage from some job  requirements. we hope this update encourages anyone with  the right experience to apply for a role at southwest! with sustained competition for available talent, we recognize  the importance of southwest’s compensation and benefits to  attracting and retaining the workforce necessary for continued  business recovery and growth. in  , we further evolved our  compensation approach to become more market competitive.  we made additional investments to attract and retain talent,  including announcing our desire to increase our starting  hourly pay rates so that all hourly employees make at least  $  per hour. we’re grateful for the ability to make this pay  increase—for our current southwest family and   those considering joining us—at one of the world’s most   admired companies.  tracking effectiveness & stakeholder engagement  we track applicant-to-hire ratios, time to hire, pipeline  strength and health, new hire turnover and retention rates,  and progress toward our dei goals. beginning in  , we’ll  also track candidate sentiment at various stages during the  hiring process. stakeholders across the organization are  regularly informed of efforts underway and progress toward  goals and are engaged in the decision-making process of  future initiatives. stakeholders include but aren’t limited to  talent acquisition, employment screening/hr operations, hr  business partners, hiring managers, the executive committee,  hr information systems and analytics teams, swa u/training  teams, employee

citizenship employee compensation, benefits, & health  at southwest, we believe in supporting our employees’  wellbeing in all aspects of their lives. that’s why we offer a  comprehensive compensation and benefits package, including  a wide variety of robust programs, initiatives, and resources  targeted at our employees’ physical, financial, and   mental health.   benefits   we provide health benefits—including medical, dental, vision,  and a host of other voluntary insurance benefits and health  support services—to help protect employees and their loved  ones. southwest’s robust retirement plan program, comprised  of a  (k) plan with a generous company match of up to   . %   of eligible earnings and a profitsharing plan, is designed to  help provide employees with long-term financial security. we  actively assess noncontract employee compensation through  monthly measurement reports, an annual merit cycle, and  third-party surveys to evaluate whether employees are in line  with, or above, market pay. to align our ground operations  employees with market pay, we invested an additional $ .    million in compensation to increase starting hourly pay rates  from $  to $  per hour effective march  ,  . our    investment of more than  $ .   billion in our employee benefit  programs, excluding  (k), profitsharing plan, and share- based compensation, reflects the importance we place on the  wellbeing of our people.  full-time and part-time employee benefits include:   ●health coverage, including medical, prescription, dental,  vision, and an employee assistance program for mental  healthcare.    ● short-term disability for noncontract employees and  employees whose collective bargaining agreement  (cba) so provides, loss of license disability for pilots, and  conventional long-term disability for all other employees.   ● company-provided life insurance and accidental death  and dismemberment insurance as well as optional life and  other voluntary benefits.   ● paid time off, including vacations, personal time, sick time,  disability, holidays, and for noncontract employees, paid  parental leave.    ● financial benefits including retirement through a  (k)  plan including company match, employee stock purchase  plan, and profitsharing plan.   ●post-retirement medical and dental coverage for  employees meeting service and age requirements (or  the requirements specified in collective bargaining  agreements for specific workgroups) from the age of  retirement until age  .  non-employee workers, such as contractors, do not receive all  the benefits listed above. we sponsor employee savings plans under section  (k)  of the internal revenue code of  , as amended. the  southwest airlines co.  (k) plan includes company  matching contributions subject to limits specified by the board  of directors, the internal revenue code, and applicable u.s.  treasury regulations. the southwest airlines pilots retirement  saving plan has non-elective company contributions. in  addition, the company may contribute a percentage of  its eligible pre-tax profits, as defined in the profitsharing  plan, on an annual basis to the southwest airlines co.  profitsharing plan (profitsharing plan)—a defined contribution  plan. no employee contributions to the profitsharing plan  are allowed. the amount associated with the company's  defined contribution plans expensed in  , reflected as a  component of salaries, wages, and benefits, was $  million.   additionally, we provide post-retirement benefits to qualified  retirees in the form of medical and dental coverage.  employees must meet service and age requirements as set  forth by the company, or as specified in collective bargaining  agreements with specific workgroups. employees meeting  these requirements, as defined, may use accrued unused sick  time to pay for medical and dental premiums (or pay them  in cash) from the age of retirement until age  . all post- retirement medical and dental benefits are unfunded, and  southwest pays benefits as they become due. estimated future  post-retirement benefit payments expected to be paid are $   million in  , $  million in  , $  million in  , $   million in  , $  million in  , and $  million for the  next five years thereafter.  regular communications are provided to our employees to  make them aware of and give them access to these resources  throughout the year. from a healthy living and diabetes  management platform to financial education sessions with a  retirement plan counselor to mental health webinars, we offer  a diverse range of options to help our employees thrive.  governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship compensation   we have a commitment to our employees built into our  compensation philosophy, which states that “our people are  our single greatest strength and most enduring long-term  competitive advantage.” to that end, southwest endeavors  to offer fair and market-competitive pay for all employees  that reflects our commitment to dei, recognizes and rewards  performance, and positions our company to successfully  retain our people. in our efforts to honor that commitment, we  put processes in place to routinely evaluate all salary changes  using five basic principles. all compensation decisions for  noncontract employees are assessed through the lens of  these guiding principles:   ●market data that is sourced from reputable third-party  surveys;  ● internal equity, which evaluates pay relative to the pay of  other employees performing similar work;   ● position history of the individual employee;   ● performance of the employee in their role;   ● and budget availability.  applying these basic principles in our compensation   decisions limits room for bias in making these decisions  for the percentage of our population that is not already  covered by cbas. as of december  ,  , approximately   % of our total employee population is covered under cbas  that prescribe compensation for all qualified employees based  generally on seniority, which helps to eliminate any potential  gender (or other protected class) bias in compensation.  for those employees not covered by a cba, the results of  the average salary by paygrade and gender chart indicate  very close parity within the organization between male and  female salaries. by reviewing our noncontract male and  female salaries by grade level, we can closely approximate  a comparison of pay equity at the job level and thereby  determine the correlation of similar pay for similar work. the  average salary by paygrade and gender chart represents  salaries for all noncontract employees, with the exception of  our named executive officers, whose salaries are disclosed  in the proxy statement  and whose salaries are determined by  the board of directors. certain paygrades may have very few  or only one employee within the grade level. as part of our  annual compensation evaluation, we review gender salary  equity on a regular basis.   citizenship people performance planet governance frameworks $-$ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ , $ ,  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g  g

addition to internal comparisons, we also assess  noncontract employee salary competitiveness with the  external market. when comparing our noncontract average  male employee salaries to the external market midpoint for  male salaries and our noncontract average female employee  salaries to the market midpoint for female salaries, the results  are similar, with variations between the male and female ratios  of approximately  % to the market average. for both male  and female employees, salaries are aligned with the external  market.  the topic of employee compensation and benefits can impact  southwest's employees directly and also can impact external factors through employee spend and participation in the  economy and society. having a stable, well-paid workforce can  positively impact the economies of the communities' where  our employees live and work. famous for an employee-first  corporate culture, southwest maintains an unprecedented  record of no involuntary furloughs or layoffs in its history.   additionally, southwest acknowledges the impact and  importance of employee wellness and is taking steps to  enhance our employee benefits and mental wellness offerings  in the hopes of improving the health and wellbeing of our  workforce.   governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship employee experience, culture, & engagement we believe our culture is truly what sets us apart from the  competition. knowing our culture was impacted during the  pandemic, we had a strong focus in   to reinvigorate our  winning culture and strengthen the employee experience.   a cornerstone of southwest’s culture is captured in our  nine company values, which describe how we show up  as individuals, how we treat each other, and how we work  together for the success of southwest. our values, combined  with our company and employee promises, define the  southwest way.  we actively invest in employee programs and events that  create opportunities for employees to hear from leadership,  connect with each other, and celebrate accomplishments.  southwest has a rich history of hosting employee-focused  events, and in  , we brought back some in-person events  such as southwest rallies (our version of town halls, which  have in-person and virtual options), an annual spirit party,  and a yearly celebration for employees celebrating milestone  anniversaries as southwest employees.  southwest also has culture ambassadors—employees in every  southwest location that champion culture efforts at the local  level—who organize these initiatives. we invest in and support  these ambassadors with dedicated training, communication,  and a platform for idea and resource sharing on an internal  company communication channel. while we can never  guarantee that every employee will have the opportunity to  participate in every event, we hope to reach the maximum  number of employees through a consistent, year-round  cadence of robust programming.  we continually strive to improve the employee experience  by investing in the moments that matter along the employee  journey. in  , our dedicated employee experience (ex)  team refreshed the moments that matter along our employee  journey by adding new moments. we also developed a  dashboard to assess the effectiveness of each moment that  pulls in employee sentiment from employee surveys and   focus groups as well as other people data and   benchmarking studies.   governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship the ex team also manages southwest’s multi-faceted  and ongoing strategy to actively listen to employees and  map the employee journey. we conduct companywide  surveys of our employees throughout the year to assess  employee engagement, job satisfaction, and opportunities  for improvement. in addition to our employee engagement  score (which is comprised of five factors), we also added a  wellbeing score in   based on six wellbeing factors. these  two scores help us measure sentiment and progress. we are  actively adding lifecycle surveys that provide employees the  opportunity to give real-time feedback for key moments all  along their employee journey (e.g., onboarding, offboarding,  etc.). through employee focus groups, we are able to dive  deeper into opportunities for improvement and gauge the  importance to our employees, so we can better prioritize  ideas for our ex roadmap and seek feedback and input directly  from our people. we actively engage with employee forums,  such as our president’s council, diversity council, and culture  ambassadors, which are comprised primarily of frontline  employees. when possible, we involve them early in the  design of new employee-focused programs to help meet the  needs of our diverse and widespread employee population.    in  , we identified several gaps in our new hire  onboarding processes through the feedback mechanisms  that identified a retention risk for new employees during a  large hiring wave as we focused on reaching pre-pandemic  staffing levels to meet travel demand. a cross-functional  team convened to identify efforts and opportunities for  improvement at both the company and individual department  levels. examples of these onboarding enhancements include:    ●a new internal new hire site on our intranet to help new  employees access the most pertinent information and  actions they need to take.    ● a wingmate program to pair new hires with a more  tenured southwest employee to welcome them and help  them in their early days at southwest.   ● enhancement to the new hire now onboarding class to  strengthen content based on new hire feedback.   ● creating a new onboarding experience team to keep  the focus on onboarding as we continue to grow as a  company.  in  , we also invested in a new recognition platform to take  our employee recognition and appreciations to the next level.  employees can earn swag points that they can redeem for  merchandise, gift cards, experiences, charitable contributions, and even rapid rewards points. these points can be earned  through various company programs, including:   ● company goals incentive : at a company level, we  designed a new   company goals incentive program,  establishing a metric and target for each of the five  company goals. each quarter, we rewarded employees  with swag points for each of the five company goals  achieved. as part of this program, we also had several  special swag point appreciations in   to thank  employees for their contributions (e.g., employee  appreciation day, southwest’s birthday, etc.).   ● peer-to-peer programs: we have a strong peer-to-peer  recognition program that enables employees to send a  kick tail (thank you) to their cohearts as well as various  nomination programs for special swag point-based  awards, including our spotlight awards, winning spirit  award, and president’s award.    ● leader-driven program:  in  , we enabled all people  leaders to give on the spot awards to employees,  increased the number of swag points a leader can give,  and added an additional swag point level so leaders  can give more swag points to employees who are going  above and beyond.   within most of these recognition programs, the sender selects  the value the recipient demonstrated, further reinforcing our  company values outlined in the southwest way.   we view ongoing investment in our employee experience as  important because it allows us to more effectively improve our  ability to attract, develop, and retain engaged employees who  will help us achieve southwest’s business objectives. at the  core, we know that our employees are vital to our competitive  advantage and taking care of their needs is important.  southwest’s culture and employee engagement positively  affects the customer experience, which ultimately leads  to a better flying experience that shines a positive light on  the airline industry. our culture has been a priority and a  distinction for decades, and it helps set us apart from other  airlines. the culture at southwest is foundational for our  brand. as we invest in employee engagement, we look to  reinvigorate our winning culture and share the heart of  southwest—with existing employees and with the thousands  of new hires we’ve welcomed to southwest as well.

are passionate about cultivating the  next generation of talent at southwest. as the needs of our  workforce evolve, we continue to update, enhance, and create  meaningful training, programs, practices, and more to support  our people. we regularly evaluate the skill sets needed by our  employees to stay competitive in an ever-changing, highly  regulated environment. in addition, our training teams strive  to offer employees the most effective and efficient learning  solutions while focusing on compliance. these efforts start  with initial training, which focuses on safety and operational  proficiency; to recurrent training, designed to refresh and  update employee skills throughout their career; to leadership  training, equipping new and seasoned leaders with the tools  and competencies to build great teams; while also offering  optional learning opportunities for employees to supplement  their development. through various training and curriculum  options such as classroom training, distance learning, on-the- job training, mentoring, and blended learning, we empower  employees to create a career that fits their goals and lifestyle.  new southwest employees receive most of their training at  our corporate campus in dallas, texas. employees start the  day with a celebratory welcome as they walk the red carpet  during their onboarding class. afterwards, employees spend  the day learning about our history, company culture, benefits,  and more. in  , we continued offering self-paced, virtual,  and in-person learning options to make learning available to  more employees. we’ve also updated the southwest learning  center to provide leaders and employees with a clean, simple  catalog of virtual training opportunities—addressing required  training needs and optional curriculum. additionally, we  introduced an enterprise-wide mentorship program available  to all employees regardless of their job titles. this program  enables employees to develop themselves professionally  and personally by learning from one another and building  new relationships within the southwest family. in  , we  matched approximately   mentor/mentee pairs in the fall  cycle of the mentorship program.  in  , we launched several new development opportunities  for leaders, including an initial leadership development  program to train new leaders, a continuous development  program for existing leaders, and an immersive leadership  program to grow high-impact leaders at the manager/ senior manager level. each program focuses on leadership  competencies, dei, business acumen, and other leadership  skills to develop dynamic and successful leaders at southwest. we’ve also continued to provide resources through our career  mobility center, a centralized resource for our employees to  learn about the skills, experiences, and education needed for  their next career step at southwest. career mobility allows  employees to meet with career mobility coaches who can  direct them to relevant classes, temporary opportunities, or  interview preparation techniques to increase diversity and  vertical and lateral mobility for all southwest employees.

approximately  % of our workforce is  represented by labor unions (as of december  ,  ). the  railway labor act (rla) establishes the right of our employees  to organize and bargain collectively. our approach to  collective bargaining focuses on negotiating agreements that  achieve positive outcomes for our people and company. for  example, in  , southwest ratified new agreements with our  appearance technicians and customer service employees.  as of march  ,  , we’ve also ratified new agreements for  our flight instructors, facilities maintenance technicians, and  dispatchers, and we remain focused on closing negotiations  with all open groups as swiftly as possible.   airlines’ collective bargaining agreements are governed by  the rla, which protects the right of employees to organize  and bargain collectively. under the rla, a collective  bargaining agreement does not expire, but instead becomes  amendable on a certain date. in  , we continued  traditional negotiations after the pandemic environment  waned, and we remain committed to reaching agreements  with our union partners in a timely manner. senior leadership  regularly receives updates on progress in negotiations, and  implementation schedules are put in place for changes when  a new agreement is reached.  the rla requires an airline and the union to negotiate and  to “exert every reasonable effort” to reach agreement. in the  event the parties are unable to reach an agreement, either one  or both parties may request the national mediation board’s  (nmb’s) mediation services. during this time, there is a long  process that must be followed before the parties could be  released from mediation and consider “self-help,” which could  include strikes by labor or implementation of management’s  proposals. since  ,  % of mediation cases overseen by  the nmb resulted in an agreement.  our annual report on form  -k contains more information  on the various unions representing our

operating cost, approximately  % of operating  expenses in  .  airlines are inherently dependent on energy to operate, with  jet fuel being one of the most volatile and unpredictable  costs. this makes it an area of interest for our stakeholders.  although the price of fuel is largely influenced by external  factors, we can still make an impact by striving for greater fuel  efficiency. because fuel management is integrated into various  work streams, we have a dedicated cross-functional working  group, our fuel design team, made up of individuals across  multiple aspects of the business that identify opportunities  to increase efficiency across work streams without impacting  safety or hospitality. this team implements, tracks, and  reports progress on various fuel saving measures, seeking  to increase alignment across the operation and improve fuel  efficiency. we maintain detailed records of our actual jet fuel  and ground fuel consumption per station for all scheduled and  unscheduled flights. for additional information on our fuel  efficiency initiatives, please reference our reduce  story in the  planet section.   greenhouse gas emissions  effectively tracking and managing the mitigation of ghgs  associated with our business is core to effective climate risk  management. to this end, we’ve publicly reported on our  emissions annually since  , bringing more than   years of  monitoring and insight into the ghg impact of our operations.  southwest follows the greenhouse gas protocol: a corporate  accounting and reporting standard (ghg protocol) guidance  to collect activity data and calculate emissions. our    greenhouse gas inventory was assessed by a third-party and  completed in accordance with the aa  assurance standard  (assurance statement for   greenhouse gas inventory ).  this assurance engagement included our scope  , scope  ,  and certain scope   ghg emissions.   southwest follows the operational control approach  defined by the ghg protocol, accounting for emissions  from operations over which we have complete authority to  apply operating practices. we calculate and incorporate the  relevant carbon dioxide (co ), methane (ch ), and nitrous  oxide (n o) emissions from our operations. emissions are  consolidated and disclosed in metric tons of carbon dioxide  equivalent (co e) using the  -year time horizon global  warming potential (gwp) values from the intergovernmental  panel on climate change (ipcc) fifth assessment report  (ar ). hydrofluorocarbons (hfcs), perfluorocarbons (pfcs),  nitrogen trifluoride (nf ), and sulfur hexafluoride (sf ) were  found to be de minimis, and therefore not reported in  association with our operations.   governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship more than  % of southwest’s scope   emissions are from  jet fuel, which is why addressing fuel is imperative to our  mitigation plans. our remaining < % of scope   emissions is  largely from ground fuel use in the form of gasoline, diesel,  and propane, as well as natural gas for heating. all scope    emissions were calculated with epa emission factors except  for jet fuel,  which used icao’s emission factors, and cng  (compressed natural gas) emissions, which used the climate  registry’s factors. scope   indirect electricity emissions were  calculated using epa’s egrid factors by subregion. additionally,  in   we included market-based scope   indirect electricity  emissions in the planet data table for the first time. previously,  we reported the scope   emissions that cover emissions from  waste generated in operations and employee commuting.  in  , we also expanded our scope   reporting to include  purchased goods and services, capital goods, and fuel and  energy-related activities. to manage our scope   and   emissions, we have set forth a  framework of voluntary interim and long-term goals, actions,  and initiatives. in  , we updated our carbon intensity  goal to the following: reduce our lifecycle carbon emissions  per revenue ton kilometer by  % by   and  % by    as compared

a a partners across the industry  in concerted work with government leaders toward this aim,  recognizing that there is much work to be done, and we  are focused on doing our part. in parallel with our efforts to  address our environmental impact, we are also engaged in  long-term policy objectives through a a which are aimed at  advancing and deploying commercially viable technology,  operations, and infrastructure for saf—all of which are  required to enable the industry transition toward net zero. environmental compliance maintaining compliance with local, state, and federal  environmental laws and regulations is fundamental to our  environmental policy. we continually work to meet our  annual goal of zero recorded environmental violations. our  environmental services team regularly conducts audits to  review compliance. we also work to improve our performance by utilizing our environmental management system (ems),  following environmental guidelines and procedures,  implementing corrective action, and training our employees  to meet our compliance goals. on a regular basis, we meet  with our airport stakeholders both in response to events and  incidents (if any), as well as to foster a collaborative approach  to our collective compliance. our standard auditing protocol assesses a location’s  recordkeeping permit status, and compliance with  requirements of regulatory plans such as storm water  pollution prevention plans, spill prevention control, and  countermeasure plans. we perform a visual walk-through  inspection to confirm that key compliance practices are  enacted in each of the cities we serve. at all our locations,  we also track spills, audit findings and corresponding  corrective action, and information about permits and their  expiration dates. we set goals and use our ems and chemical  management system (cms) to aid in our effort to maintain  compliance with environmental regulations, minimize  costs and risk, and measure our efforts to improve our  environmental performance.    we also track environmental issues that may have an impact  to the broader aviation industry, such as the increased  focus of governmental agencies on per- and polyfluoroalkyl  substances (pfas). pfas are a key component in aqueous film- forming foam (afff), which is widely used to fight petroleum- based fires at both commercial and military aviation facilities.  the faa and the u.s. department of defense have strict  performance specifications for fire suppression systems, which  has contributed to the use of afff/pfas over the decades.  pfas is now the focus of regulatory oversight at airports,  as well as the source of litigation by airports against afff  manufacturers. moreover, regulatory authorities at the federal,  state, and local levels are contemplating both the prohibition  of pfas-based afff and costly remediation efforts at airports  to address groundwater contamination. southwest actively  monitors the

governance frameworks citizenship facilities energy use southwest airlines actively looks for opportunities to address  our environmental impact at our owned and operated  facilities. we constantly evaluate and explore ongoing  opportunities to embed sustainability into our   facility operations.   we are also actively assessing energy efficiency, water  conservation, and construction practices at southwest. we are  mindful of the impact of our facilities on the environment, and  we have taken action to address those impacts. here are a few  steps southwest is taking:   ●evaluating and exploring efforts to integrate energy  conscious considerations into our facilities standards,  including developing an energy roadmap that may include  facility-level sustainability goals.   ● finding opportunities to build efficiently and to obtain  leed certifications during construction when appropriate.    ● participating in energy mitigation events to save energy  and support our community at our corporate campus in  dallas.   ● continuing efforts to improve recycling programs across  our system, address our waste and pollution, and measure  and address our scope   natural gas and scope    electricity emissions from our facilities. waste southwest is working to address our environmental impact  through sustainable waste and recycling initiatives. our goal  is to help conserve natural resources by addressing the use  of raw materials and comply with applicable local, state,  and federal environmental laws and regulations regarding  hazardous and non-hazardous waste. to this end, we closely  track and monitor our waste generation each year, analyzing  trends across our stations where we manage waste and  recycling, and breaking waste streams out by category and  status. one of our most innovative initiatives is a unique  global sustainability initiative, repurpose with purpose, that  transforms leather seat coverings into new, upcycled products.  in addition, we educate and engage our employees about our  internal recycling practices and share recycling tips they can  use at work and at home. for additional information on waste  generation, please refer to the planet data table . water at southwest, we understand the importance of water  conservation. although our water consumption is minimal in  comparison to our total environmental impact, we work with  certain airports throughout our network to control storm water  runoff and mitigate environmental impacts to nearby bodies  of water.  storm water effluent from airports is regulated under the  epa’s national pollutant discharge elimination system  (npdes) program. permits are issued to each airport or to  individual airlines operating at an airport under the npdes  program so that aircraft deicing fluid runoff and fluids used  to maintain aircraft and equipment are properly managed to  prevent adverse impacts to the environment. we work with  the airports we serve to take measures to address runoff  related to aircraft deicing, including aircraft deicing fluid  recovery and other related pollution-reduction technologies.  as well, we support storm water management efforts by  maintaining compliance with regulatory plans, such as  storm water pollution prevention plans (swppp) and spill  prevention, control, and countermeasure plans (spcc), and  by including the topic of storm water protection in our annual  environmental training required for all our operational groups.   although water consumption is a small part of our operations,  it is an important natural resource, and we strive to take  measures to conserve water in our facilities and landscaping.  the majority of our water consumption comes from domestic  use by our employees, and we have implemented projects to  target conservation in this area in order to preserve this   natural resource. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship safety southwest airlines’ operational philosophy defines key  principles and expectations for frontline employees. most  importantly, and without compromise, we put safety first.  employees are expected to follow company policies and  procedures designed to enable operations at an acceptable  level of risk for southwest in compliance with regulatory  requirements. next, and only after operating safely, we  balance being low-cost and reliable, all delivered with world- class hospitality. the operational philosophy provides a  framework to offer employees a safe work environment, our  customers a safe travel experience, and, in turn, position  southwest airlines for success. this operational philosophy  positively impacts our customers and employees and helps to  mitigate potential, negative impacts of the operation.  at southwest, our commitment to safety is embodied in our  safety management system (sms), which establishes the  framework that enables southwest to operate safely. the sms  framework is comprised of four main components: safety  policy, safety risk management, safety assurance, and safety  promotion. these components are seamlessly integrated into  all of our processes, establishing a robust structure for safety  at southwest. southwest’s safety policy is reflected in our safety and security  commitment, which is a public pledge made by all southwest  employees and senior leadership to the safety and security of  our customers and employees. it establishes clear company  and employee expectations for safety and security and holds  our employees accountable for meeting these expectations.  southwest’s safety policy also covers our safety and security  objectives, including safety objectives specific to supporting  employees and reducing injuries. southwest employees are  expected to demonstrate their commitment to safety by:    ●following company policies and procedures    ●identifying anything that could cause damage or injury    ●reporting hazards through companywide reporting tools    ●knowing and understanding our safety and security  commitment    our operational processes incorporate participation from  employees to help identify, develop, and implement  procedural changes, including those specific to mitigating  hazards (anything that could cause injury or damage) or  negative impacts. being accountable to the safety and security  commitment is yet another way that our employees offer our  customers the hospitality we’re known for—through the lens  of a safe operation. citizenship people performance planet governance frameworks operational philosophy operational philosophy the safety risk management function of our sms provides  a proactive, systemic, and standardized process designed  to identify hazards and risks to the operation and workplace  before they become injuries, accidents, or incidents. it is  designed to mitigate risk through the implementation of  effective risk controls, including tools, technology, and  training. one example of our commitment to safety is the  implementation of fire containment bags on all of our aircraft.  with the increasing use of electronic devices that contain  rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, there’s a growing risk of  overheating and fire. to address this issue, southwest invested  in fire containment bags that are designed to contain and  extinguish any potential fires. these bags play a critical role  in our efforts to mitigate the level of risk and maintain the  highest level of safety for our customers and employees. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship all areas of the sms receive companywide and department- specific safety promotion support, which includes both  training and communication related to safety. southwest  developed specific job function training built around  comprehensive standards intended to provide employees  the skills they need to operate safely. we also have a robust  engagement strategy to promote and educate stakeholders  regarding the company’s safety and security commitment.  it includes communication at the enterprise level through  a variety of channels, targeted communication to frontline  employees with safety messaging refined to their areas of  risk, and leadership communication that identifies trends and  provides talking points for leaders to share areas of concern or  improvement. leaders are also able to access results for their  specific location and workgroup to determine what their focus  areas should be to improve results moving forward. sms is  designed to create and foster a strong safety culture through  knowledge and understanding. our comprehensive approach  supports our commitment to making safety a top priority.the safety assurance function of the sms relies on data  and analytics to continuously measure and analyze the  effectiveness of risk controls and overall safety performance.  southwest monitors safety performance using a variety of  data including employee reporting, aircraft information,  safety investigations, fatigue programs, and audits. audit data  is specifically used to proactively evaluate the effectiveness  of safety risk controls. we proactively look for things that  can cause injury or damage when we implement a new or  changed policy or procedure. we also monitor safety risk  controls through assurance systems. not only do we look at  recent controls implemented, but we are always continuously  monitoring controls that have been in our systems for an  extended period of time. we use our assurance programs to  look at control effectiveness across all operational processes;  when we have indications that are not what we expect, we do  further analysis and have formalized the system assessment  process to document decisions and fixes when the safety  performance is not acceptable. in  , we conducted more  than   system assessments. for example, a recent change  identified through data was an enhancement to the safety  features of our provisioning trucks. we implemented a fall  mitigation for our provisioning agents by using an engineered  control to prevent the back curtain of the provisioning truck  from being open while the back of the truck is raised. a fall  from the height of a raised truck could cause serious injury, so  implementing the fix reduces that level of risk and enhances  employee safety. we also conduct further analysis when  something we are monitoring is performing really well and  look for opportunities to implement similar concepts or ideas  in current or upcoming projects. one example of this is our  very successful etops (extended operations) program. we  implemented etops post-sms, so it required us to conduct  safety risk management. as we built our processes, we  proactively identified hazards and developed risk controls to  manage the risk prior to operating any etops flight. as an  added benefit, this provided the ability to also build in robust  assurance. as we implemented safety risk controls, we knew  what data we needed to collect and developed areas to use  automation to assist in continuous monitoring. each area we  monitor has defined metrics, which are regularly reviewed and  presented to the etops advisory board. as well, we regularly evaluate our performance against safety  objectives which include reducing injuries and damage in the  operation. during the past couple of years, with significant  changes to the operational environment, we were able to  use data to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of our  risk controls and target areas to improve performance. we  monitored the changes supporting the restoration of the  operation post covid-  and onboarding thousands of new  employees with excellent results; our employees demonstrate  a commitment to keeping each other and our customers safe.   citizenship people performance planet governance frameworks components of sms governance        southwest

allows for simplified  scheduling in our point-to-point network. it also helps  streamline our operating procedures and training approach  for our employees and business partners. above all, operating  a single fleet type helps us maintain focus on our number  one priority—safety for our employees and customers. while  our fleet management strategy has many benefits, we do  recognize our reliance on a single manufacturer. we regularly  review our fleet strategy with senior leadership and our board  of directors to validate our operational and fleet philosophy.     part of our approach to fleet management also involves a  focus on fleet modernization as we recognize the importance  of operating aircraft that are more fuel efficient, optimal  for our operation, and which provide our customers a  comfortable experience. to support that goal, as of december   ,  , we have firm orders for more than    new -  and  -  aircraft through   to replace older - s—bringing more  fuel efficiency and lowering operating costs.   as compared with the prior generation of   aircraft, the -   and -  aircraft, with leap- b engines (cfm international),  provide increased fuel efficiency, a quieter

strategy blends nonstop and connecting routes  to the top destinations customers want to fly, designed  around the local demand in the communities we serve.  more than   years of replicating this model has established  southwest as a preferred carrier (no.   in market share) in    of the top   u.s. markets, and we have the no.   or no.    market share in   domestic cities. as of december  ,   , southwest served   nonstop city pairs connecting  more than   airports, resulting in no connections required  for approximately  % of southwest customers. and, for  customers who need to connect, southwest leverages more  than   cities as connect points across our network, an  intentional strategic move to set us apart from the competition  which utilizes only a few hubs for connections.   southwest has boldly taken advantage of network  opportunities since  . during the covid-  pandemic, we  put idle aircraft to work and utilized our people to capitalize on  new network opportunities, supporting southwest’s short- term recovery and long-term growth. as part of our recovery from the impacts of the covid-  pandemic, southwest  remains focused on maturing newer markets and restoring its  network to pre-pandemic levels through adding back breadth  and frequency to southwest’s network while balancing  our network schedule with our crew resources. in    specifically, we prioritized

opportunities impacting  operations and providing diagnostic analysis to inform  decisions, including crew staffing and productivity.   ● providing timely operational performance reporting,  forecasting operational trends (including on-time  performance trends), and informing our network design  decisions.   ● assessing how we design, build, and operate a schedule  with a focus on proper staffing and capacity planning,  overseeing station readiness and improvements, and  strategically responding to unplanned events (e.g.,  covid-  or weather events).  of course, our focus extends beyond merely monitoring our  current performance. we have a defined governance structure  in place that provides a clear process to efficiently assess,  approve, manage, and deliver outcomes of strategic projects  within our operations portfolio, with the goal of continuously  advancing our operational capabilities. southwest is also  always looking for new innovations and tools to shape the  future of our airline. this includes regularly developing and  testing operational enhancements in simulated and real- world environments to foster a forward-thinking approach  to our operational tools and processes through continuous  improvement, data science and automation, and a focus  on emerging trends. while we will always be proud of our  operational legacy, we have our sights set on planning for the  operation of the future so that we can continue to offer our  employees and customers a reliable, efficient, and modern  airline experience. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one report governance people performance planet governance frameworks citizenship customer satisfaction  southwest airlines’ operational philosophy is based on the  belief that the company prospers when we are safe, low cost,  reliable, and hospitable. delivering hospitality means that  southwest employees and customers feel welcomed, cared  for, and appreciated. we have dedicated teams in place to  provide resources and training opportunities to support our  people in continuing the legacy of legendary hospitality that  southwest is known for. a key component of southwest’s  vision is to be the world’s most loved airline. we work to  achieve this vision by:   ●improving customer satisfaction by enhancing current  offerings and working to remove friction from the  customer journey.   ● bolstering customer loyalty by providing proactive  customer engagement and convenient assistance.  we measure “most loved” through regular reporting on  key metrics like the department of transportation’s (dot)  customer satisfaction results, net promoter score (nps), and  trip net promoter score (tnps). we actively solicit customer  feedback on their southwest travel experience through regular  post-trip surveys. customers share their level of satisfaction  with multiple aspects of their travel experience, including  airport lobby, tsa screening, gate area, boarding process,  inflight experience, connection process, deplaning process,  and baggage claim. we use these insights to understand wins  and pain points for our customers across all aspects of their  travel journey and all southwest stations to inform future  actions. in  , southwest announced major customer  experience enhancements. we are always looking for  additional opportunities to equip our employees to serve our  customers with even more warmth, hospitality, and heart,  giving our customers more reasons than ever to fly southwest.  for more details on our customer experience enhancements,  please see the transforming the customer experience  story  for additional information.  the external impact of legendary customer service is  represented in the thought that treating customers right is  not only good for business, but good for society as well. the  heart in our logo celebrates the dignity and worth of every  human being. southwest seeks to raise the bar for customer  satisfaction throughout the entire aviation industry—but our  desire to provide top service doesn’t stop there. we aspire  to be the gold standard for customer satisfaction for every  company worldwide. internally, southwest relies heavily  on highly engaged employees to produce the culture and  customer experience that has made southwest famous.  the southwest model lends itself to first creating a strong  employee experience and culture, and from that comes an  excellent customer experience. governance        southwest airlines one report pb      southwest airlines one

states  ("gaap"). these gaap financial statements may include (i) unrealized noncash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a  result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii)  other charges and benefits the company believes are unusual and/or infrequent in nature and thus may make comparisons to its prior or future  performance difficult.      as a result, the company also provides financial information in this report that was not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be  considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with gaap. the company provides supplemental non-gaap financial  information (also referred to as "excluding special items"), including results that it refers to as "economic," which the company's management  utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental  information to its gaap results. the non-gaap measures provided that relate to the company’s performance on an economic fuel cost basis  include: net income, non-gaap.      the company's economic fuel and oil expense results differ from gaap results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel  hedge contracts—all reflected within fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. thus, fuel and oil expense on an economic basis has  historically been utilized by the company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the company’s actual net cash  outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. any net premium costs paid related to option contracts  that are designated as hedges are reflected as a component of fuel and oil expense, for both gaap and non-gaap (including economic) purposes  in the period of contract settlement. the company believes these economic results provide further insight into the impact of the company's fuel  hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, noncash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded  in gaap results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel  derivative contracts within fuel and oil expense. this enables the company's management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess  the company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel  expense. however, because these measures are not determined in accordance with gaap, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations,  and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. as a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly  comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.      further information on (i) the company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes  of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in note   to the consolidated financial  statements on form  -k for the fiscal year ended december  ,  .      the company’s gaap results in the applicable periods may include other charges or benefits that are also deemed "special items," that the  company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends. financial measures  identified as non-gaap (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. for the periods presented, in addition to the  items discussed above, special items include:      • proceeds related to the payroll support programs, which were used to pay a portion of employee salaries, wages, and benefits;   • changes and adjustments to previously accrued amounts related to the company's extended leave programs;   •  adjustments for prior period losses reclassified from aoci associated with forward-starting interest rate swap agreements that were terminated  in prior periods related to   -  aircraft leases; • noncash impairment charges, primarily associated with adjustments to salvage values for previously retired airframes;   • unrealized mark-to-market adjustment associated with certain available for sale securities; and   • losses associated with the partial extinguishment of the company’s convertible notes and early prepayment of debt.number endnote description pb      southwest airlines one report frameworks frameworks        southwest airlines

management determined that presentation within its income statement would be enhanced by classification of loss on  extinguishment of debt as a separate line item, rather than its prior presentation where it was included as a component of other (gains) losses,  net. such losses are incurred as a result of opportunistic decisions made by the company to prepay portions of its debt, most of which was taken  on during the pandemic in order to provide liquidity during the prolonged downturn in air travel. due to the nature of these losses, which are  difficult to accurately predict, and due to the fact that they are not representative of the company’s day-to-day airline operating performance,  the company has included such amounts as special items and thus excluded them from certain of its non-gaap measures in the accompanying  reconciliation.      because management believes special items can distort the trends associated with the company’s ongoing performance as an airline, the  company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact  of special items, in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis  for evaluating operating results in future periods. the following measure is often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the company’s  management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to industry trends: net income, non-gaap.      information regarding special items and reconciliation of reported amounts to amounts excluding special items are included in the accompanying  reconciliation table in the performance section.   as of
