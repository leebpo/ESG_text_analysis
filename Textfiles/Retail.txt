diversity, equality, and inclusion at ross, our values start with our people.  we are dedicated to supporting diverse teams and maintaining an inclusive company that respects, values, and celebrates the vast array of backgrounds, identities, and ideas of those who work for and shop with us. with our policies, programs, and procedures, we work to maintain a culture that promotes respect, equality, and dignity across our company and in each individual workplace. throughout our stores, distribution centers, and offices, we expect associates to exhibit our commitment to de&i in their interactions with customers and fellow associates alike.  our day-to-day work in this area is led  by the office of de&i, which continues to grow, and we are guided by two important bodies: the de&i steering committee and the de&i council. the de&i steering committee is co-chaired by our chief executive officer and chief operating officer and is comprised of senior executives from across the company who ensure that our de&i strategy is integrated into our culture and how we work. the de&i council, chaired by our group vice president of diversity, equality, and inclusion, includes cross-functional senior leaders who are responsible for developing  functional action plans that support our  de&i vision and objectives.  while ross has always been steadfast in  its commitment to de&i, we have made  significant progress in advancing our efforts  in recent years. for our efforts in  , we  were recognized by newsweek magazine as  one of “america’s greatest workplaces for  diversity” and one of “america’s greatest  workplaces for women.” we also received  a   out of   rating on the human rights  campaign foundation’s corporate equality  index, which rates workplaces on equality  and

business ethically empowering our associatesour commitment to diversity, equality, and inclusion nurturing a respectful culture  we aim to foster an environment where communication is  open and civil, conflict is addressed early and respectfully, and there is a culture of inclusion.  to that end, in  , we continued our commitment to  fostering de&i learning by providing training across all levels of the organization.  leaders across the company completed instructor- led inclusive leadership training. this training provides leaders with skills to maintain trusting and inclusive work environments that enable their teams to do their best work, while guiding them through the process of developing an action plan for implementing inclusive behaviors.  in addition, associates participated in de&i training which  was delivered in different formats, including e-learning as well as instructor-led trainings. ross curates the content, enabling us to support our specific de&i goals. we continue to expand our de&i education offerings to leaders and associates with additional learning resources. as part of our efforts to ensure we recruit and develop  diverse talent, we also provided specialized de&i experience-based training to all managers and above in human resources and created standardized tools and training to help mitigate potential unconscious bias in succession planning and talent calibration discussions.  we have integrated de&i training into the onboarding process  for all associates and participants in our internship program. on an annual basis, we provide training on ross’ code of business conduct and ethics for full-time associates and non-harassment training for all associates. to build on these efforts, we continue to offer on-demand learning resources and guided roundtable discussions about a variety of topics on our dedicated de&i portal for associates.  attracting and retaining diverse talent our talent acquisition teams continue to drive our efforts to recruit and retain associates from diverse backgrounds. all job postings include our de&i commitment statement, and we continue to search for opportunities to broaden our recruitment pipeline. we post jobs at all levels on a broad range of career sites, including sites focused on diverse job seekers. examples include handshake beyond pride as well as professional diversity network, which shares our roles across additional recruiting platforms. in  , we established or extended partnerships with  historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) and major national organizations including ascend, diversityinc., human rights campaign, mba veterans network, national black mba association, national organization on disability, nextup, prospanica, and seramount. these organizations not only help ross identify diverse talent to add to our ranks, but also provide information, content, and resources to assist in the development and advancement of our associates.  we also expanded our efforts to increase diversity in our  internship program and our early career positions by partnering with organizations such as the black retail action group, working with hbcus, and participating in several diversity-focused recruitment efforts with organizations such as the national retail federation and   the fashion scholarship fund. nextup advancing all  women in business      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethically empowering our associatesour commitment to diversity, equality, and inclusion continuing to build community networks in  , ross furthered its commitment to instilling  a sense of community and belonging among our associates. we expanded to six community networks, company-recognized groups of associates with common identities who come together for activities that support the company’s overarching de&i vision and objectives. the networks are being developed to include various dimensions of diversity, such as race, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, and military experience.  these groups help shape an even more inclusive  environment, enabling networking opportunities, enhancing professional development, and amplifying commemorative holidays and dates of significance. in  , the networks held more than   events, including a veteran’s day speaker panel hosted by the military community network (valor), a diwali celebration hosted by the inspirasian community network, a speaker series for national hispanic heritage month hosted by latinx connect, a black history month career panel hosted by the black/african american community (blaac) at ross, and an education session with pflag hosted by ross pride. we also support social justice efforts and invest in diverse  communities where we operate. in  , we made donations to several organizations working to advance de&i, which are further described in the “supporting our communities” chapter of this report.  recognizing diverse holidays and  commemorative events in  , ross highlighted a wide array of annual  commemorative events and holidays to recognize the diversity of our associates. these observances included black history month, women’s history month and international women’s day, national developmental disabilities month, asian pacific american heritage month, mental health awareness month, pride month, juneteenth, national hispanic heritage month, national native american heritage month, veterans day, and many others.  throughout the calendar year, observances are  commemorated with internal and external touchpoints, such as the distribution of historical facts, educational resources, and associate stories, as well as additional communications including videos, signage, and social media posts. community networks often host special events tied to these holidays and commemorative months such as seminars, discussions, networking events, and other engagements for associates. we also recognized the need for associates to have  dedicated time to honor the breadth of diverse holidays and events that they may observe individually. in  , we introduced diversity day, an additional paid day off for corporate and buying office associates. whether it is participating in a juneteenth celebration, a pride march, a religious observance, veterans day, or other holidays and events, eligible associates can choose to use their diversity day in a way that is personally meaningful. ross does a great job supporting  not only veterans but also their  families. the transition from  serving your country in the military  to stepping out into a civilian  career can be scary and difficult.  one of the things ross does really  well through their de&i efforts  is to support the conversation  about what a veteran and their  family can bring to the table and  how that can be leveraged.   —  ross associate and military

ethically operating sustainably    corporate social responsibility report  about environmental sustainability at ross overview sustainability is ingrained in ross’ culture. for decades,  we have worked hard to drive out waste and inefficiency from our operations, which, in turn, has reduced our impact on the environment. as our company grows and as part of our commitment to aligning our practices to our values, we recognize the need to advance our ambitions to help create a sustainable future for all, while also delivering value to our customers. in  , we continued our commitment to transparency  by participating in the cdp   climate change questionnaire, receiving a score of b on our disclosure.*  we also continue to pursue our target of reducing scope    &   greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by   percent per square foot by   versus a   baseline; more information about our progress can be found in the climate and energy overview section of this report. we have organized our ghg emissions to align with the greenhouse gas protocol’s scope definitions. • scope   emissions are from sources that are owned or controlled by ross.  • scope   emissions are from the generation of energy and electricity purchased by ross.  • scope   emissions are from sources not owned or controlled by ross.   last year, we announced our ambition to reach net-zero ghg emissions by   or sooner. in support of that ambition, ross developed a target to reduce our absolute scope   and   emissions by  % by   against a   baseline. this target is consistent with the united nations’ paris agreement guidelines and aligns with an emissions pathway intended to limit global warming to  .  degrees celsius. we are continuing to explore strategies to achieve this ambition and target while also creating business value and we look forward to sharing our progress on ghg reduction as well as other aspects of our environmental sustainability efforts in our public disclosures, like the cdp questionnaire and future csr reports. our focus we understand that the health of our environment is directly linked to the health of our company. environmental sustainability is an important issue for all businesses to consider when conducting operations, and our sustainability strategy is informed by the specific nature of our operations.  we conducted an assessment to determine which  environmental sustainability issues are most important to our associates, stakeholders, and communities. we concluded that the most critical environmental areas of opportunity in our operations are ghg emissions, energy use, and waste. while water is not a significant area of impact for ross, we are aware of the importance of water conservation and have programs in place to be efficient in our water usage.  program oversight to ensure that our environmental sustainability strategy is aligned with our business strategy and has the adequate support and guidance to be successful, we have established robust program governance. at the top of our sustainability program governance is our board of directors. the audit committee of the board of directors assists the board with oversight of the sustainability program and climate risks, and  it receives regular reports on the company’s environmental sustainability efforts.  ross has also established the cross-functional environmental  sustainability steering committee (essc), comprised of senior leaders from across the company, including those from store operations, supply chain, property development, finance, indirect procurement, and legal teams. the essc is responsible for identifying and managing risks and opportunities associated with climate change, informing and endorsing ghg emissions and waste reduction strategies, and identifying and supporting projects in pursuit of achieving those strategies. additionally, the essc provides input to a dedicated sustainability team and aligns ross’ sustainability program with overall business strategy.  business unit leaders who implement and oversee energy  efficiency, energy management, and waste minimization efforts across the company are critical members of our sustainability program. our management provides regular updates to the audit committee regarding the company’s environmental and sustainability efforts and the status of our initiatives.  *cdp,

intended to limit global warming to  .  degrees celsius. in addition, in  , we explored ross’ carbon reduction pathways for emissions from our own operations as well as our indirect scope   emissions.  we continued our commitment to transparency by  submitting the cdp climate change questionnaire in  , receiving a b on our submission for the third consecutive year. we responded to cdp again in  , and our response includes our   ghg inventory, as well as detailed information about our climate-related risks, opportunities, strategies, and management. climate-related risks ross continues to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. as a company that was founded and is headquartered in california, we are conscious of the threat posed by the increased prevalence of wildfires. in addition, we have stores and operations across the united states and in guam and are susceptible to extreme weather events that have been intensified by climate change, such as hurricanes and floods. these direct physical risks, along with other physical and transition risks impacting our direct operations and global supply chain, are likely to become more severe as the planet continues to warm.  to further our understanding of the future impacts of  climate change on our business, we are performing a tcfd-aligned climate-related scenario analysis. please see our   cdp response for additional details on our response to climate-related risks.  overview of ghg emissions  on an annual basis, ross completes a ghg accounting of our scope   and   impacts and a measurement of certain categories of our scope   impact. we are expanding our measurement capabilities to understand impacts associated with additional relevant scope   categories.  our   ghg inventory was assembled in accordance  with industry standards, including guidelines from the greenhouse gas protocol, the climate registry, and the u.s. environmental protection agency’s center for corporate climate leadership. our reported   ghg scope  ,  , and   emissions were also verified by a third party to assure accuracy and completeness.  ghg emissions are typically reported in terms of metric  tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mt co e). the intensity of our scope   and   emissions per square foot decreased approximately   percent between our ghg emissions target baseline year of

responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy details we endeavor to decrease our energy intensity year  over year, which reduces our environmental impact and associated costs. please see the table on page   for additional details on our multi-year energy usage.  in  , the electricity purchased to operate our facilities  represented   percent of our total energy consumption, as measured in megawatt hours (mwh) and gigajoules (gj). the great majority of that purchased electricity was used to operate our ross dress for less and dd’s discounts stores. energy efficiency because electricity consumption is such a large part of our energy usage and operational emissions, an important aspect of our ghg management strategy addresses electricity use in our buildings. our investments in lighting, insulation, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (hvac), and building energy management systems have enabled us to reduce electricity use. we have teams committed to finding new and better ways to achieve energy efficiency through improved processes and new technologies. we are also piloting energy audits at select locations to identify new opportunities to optimize energy use. since  , we have decreased the electricity per square foot required to power our stores, distribution facilities, and offices by over   percent. supporting electrical grid stability ross participates in demand response programs to help support local electrical grids. through these programs, we voluntarily reduce our energy usage during peak demand times to alleviate strain on the grid and help prevent blackouts or brownouts. we reduce our electricity usage by utilizing energy management systems that are integrated with our stores to adjust hvac systems. by doing so, we are helping keep the lights on for our customers and supporting the overall health and stability of the local electrical system. ross had nearly   stores participating in demand response programs in  , and we aim to expand our participation to more locations in  .renewable energy ross has solar panels installed on the roof of select stores. because a majority of our stores are leased, options to invest in on-site renewable energy generation are limited. we continue to evaluate opportunities and partnerships to pursue renewable energy in meaningful ways, including installing solar panels to generate electricity at our next distribution center and evaluating  other opportunites for on-site solar. total  electricity  usage by  location % stores   % offices  % distribution  facilities      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy efficiency  stores for many years, we have made investments to  decrease the amount of energy used by our climate control and lighting systems, which consume most of the electricity purchased to operate our stores.  technologies such as led lighting and high- efficiency hvac units have significantly decreased the electricity required to operate these systems. we had led lighting installed in nearly all of our stores, and led lighting will be installed in all of our new stores for the foreseeable future. additionally, we use high-efficiency hvac units whenever possible by retrofitting existing hvac equipment or by including them in new store builds.  to further reduce the energy required to operate  climate control and lighting systems, we utilize an advanced building energy management platform that enables more precise control over our energy management and shaves off unnecessary electricity use. this technology also allows us to quickly and easily adjust occupancy schedules, lighting levels, and temperatures across our stores, which provides operational benefits in addition to energy savings. this system also allows for remote diagnosis of hvac issues to quickly identify and correct inefficiencies, which can prevent unnecessary downtime and costly technician visits to our stores. we can also quickly respond to requests to lower our electricity usage to help electric utilities avoid rolling blackouts during critical periods like heat waves. through the use of this platform, we estimate that we have reduced energy usage at our stores by more than   million kilowatt-hours from when we began piloting in   through the end of  .  we also design our new stores with efficiency at the  center, understanding that investments in the earliest stage of store development pay off for years to come. in addition to including led lighting, high-efficiency hvac equipment, and advanced energy management systems, some of our locations use thicker, higher-quality insulation than is required by code and white roofs to deflect heat. these actions result in new stores that are more energy efficient, which lowers our energy usage, environmental impact, and costs. as we continue to add more stores over the long term, efficient new store design will be critical for mitigating our environmental impact. energy management  platform reduced usage  at stores by more than    million kilowatt- hours since        corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy efficiency  distribution centers ross’ distribution and warehouse facilities represent a  smaller portion of our electricity consumption and, on average, use less energy per square foot to operate than do our stores.  • we utilize an “air purging” program that uses natural air to cool our facilities. during the day, the sun heats up our buildings. at night when temperatures drop, we purge the hot air from the building and welcome in fresh, naturally cool air. this allows us to avoid several hours of air conditioning, saving energy costs. moreover, the purging program reduces our electricity demand during peak daytime hours and therefore reduces pressure on the electrical grid.  • we use highly efficient conveyor systems with variable frequency drives, sensors, and automation that shuts off equipment when not in demand. • we have led lighting and sensors that shut off lights when areas of a facility are not in use. many of our facilities also have skylights to take advantage of natural light.  • we use battery-powered forklifts and material-handling equipment to move merchandise within many of our distribution facilities. in general, this battery-operated equipment is more energy efficient and has a lower overall cost of ownership as compared to its fuel-powered counterparts.  • our new distribution centers are designed with energy efficiency in mind, with white roofs to reflect sunlight and advanced building energy management systems. our roofs are also “solar ready.”  • we are integrating solar electric power generation at a future distribution center.  • we performed energy audits at select distribution centers and identified additional opportunities to optimize energy use.  all of these approaches help our distribution centers reduce air pollution, limit ghg emissions, and achieve cost savings.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy efficiency  offices, employee  commuting, and travel our corporate headquarters in dublin, california, achieved leadership in  energy and environmental design (leed) gold certification from the u.s. green building council, with features that increase our associates’ comfort while minimizing our environmental impact. the sustainability features of our headquarters include energy management  equipment such as high-efficiency hvac equipment, energy star appliances, and lighting with motion sensors and daylight controls. additionally, we converted our interior and exterior lighting to leds.  we also enabled lower-emission transportation options by having on-site  electric vehicle charging stations, providing bicycle storage and changing facilities, and locating the campus close to public transportation. we also offer programs that help our associates to pay for public transportation using pre-tax dollars.  we support lower-carbon travel options for the field leadership organization,  which supports stores across the country. one of the key functions of our field leaders is to visit and provide direct guidance to stores in their area, which means many of these leaders spend a lot of time on the road. to help lower the ghg impact of these visits, ross has a corporate fleet of primarily hybrid vehicles. we estimate that we would have used over   percent more fuel in   if our fleet contained only conventional vehicles.       corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy efficiency  product transportation although ross does not own the trucks, trains, and ocean vessels that transport our  products, we know that the impact of transporting our products is a significant source of indirect emissions.  we work continuously with our transportation providers to improve shipping efficiency  across our distribution network as we grow our business and store base.  some of the strategies we deployed in   include: •  shipments were consolidated whenever possible to reduce the number of trips to  stores each day.  •  we shipped by rail whenever possible, which is less polluting than standard ground  transportation. approximately   percent of outbound freight from our distribution centers was shipped via rail in  .  •  approximately   percent of our transportation partners participated in the  smartway partnership, a u.s. environmental protection agency program that improves fuel efficiency and reduces air pollution.  •  the capacity of each trailer was maximized through floor loading and removing  unnecessary packaging, leading to fewer shipments.  •  we completed route optimization projects, which eliminate  .  million over-the- road miles from store deliveries on an annual basis. we have processes in place to continue reviewing opportunities to reduce miles and routes quarterly as we grow.  •  we utilized electric yard vehicles at select distribution centers to replace vehicles  with internal combustion engines.  •  we worked with international transportation partners on optimal loading of containers  shipped on ocean vessels. this lowered the number of containers needed to ship our products from overseas, reducing the total number of shipments and emissions.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablywaste management and recycling overview  the waste we generate is one of our company’s most  material impacts, and we work hard to manage and reduce our waste footprint.  we have waste diversion programs in our stores,  distribution centers, and corporate and buying offices, and we encourage our associates to participate in practices that increase our recycling, reduce waste, and decrease our use of natural resources. much of the operational waste we produce at our stores and distribution centers is from the packaging in which our merchandise is shipped. because of our off-price business model, a lot of our merchandise is produced to other retailers’ specifications. we often do not have control over the types of packaging on our products, so we focus on developing and executing programs to reuse and recycle the packaging we receive.  waste diversion from landfill we measure the percentage of our waste that we divert from landfill across our retail operations. this measurement includes all stores and ross-controlled distribution centers and warehouses. in  , our estimated landfill diversion remained approximately   percent.* waste   diversion  %   *this figure is approximate. we expect the accuracy of our waste measurements to improve over time.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyminimizing waste  stores approximately two-thirds of our operational waste is  generated in our stores; a significant portion of that waste is cardboard.  because they represent such a large percentage of our  waste footprint, cardboard boxes are an important part of our effort to reduce our waste and demonstrate our commitment to being a responsible retailer.  a majority of our stores participate in a cardboard  recycling program in which used boxes are backhauled to a regional facility, baled, and delivered to a recycling partner. this effort to recycle quickly adds up. across participating stores in  , we recycled over  ,  tons of cardboard through the backhaul recycling program, and we are investigating opportunities to expand this program to more stores.  in addition, we work with our local waste and recycling  partners and with landlords to make cardboard recycling receptacles available whenever possible in locations where we are unable to backhaul. other recycling and waste reduction  programs in our stores include: • reusable bags: we sell branded reusable  shopping bags at our stores.  • shopping bags with recycled content: all the plastic and paper shopping bags we provide to customers contain recycled material.  • reusable hangers: we avoid single-use hangers when possible and have a reuse program for store hangers.  • dumpster rightsizing: we continuously adjust the number of trash dumpsters and enhance collection schedules to help stores optimize their recycling rates.  • service automation: we are implementing technology that ensures trash compactors are only serviced when full, reducing unnecessary pickups and hauling expenses.  • digital resources: to reduce paper waste, many of our reports, trainings, policies, and other resources are available digitally.  • other diversion programs: in certain geographies, we have pursued other diversion efforts, such as organic waste programs and single-stream recycling. we also have programs to manage regulated and electronic waste.       corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyminimizing waste  distribution centers our distribution centers receive merchandise  from many countries. we process and ship these goods to stores across the country, typically in cardboard boxes.  we use a packing and shipping system that  minimizes the number of boxes and trucks required to deliver merchandise, as well as a system to recycle the millions of boxes we receive each year. as a result, we recycled over  ,  tons of material generated in our distribution centers in  .  we continuously look for ways to optimize  how products are packaged for shipping, which includes working upstream with our suppliers and within our facilities to minimize unnecessary packaging materials when possible. we also reuse the cardboard boxes in which we receive merchandise from our suppliers when possible.  we test new recycling systems at our  distribution centers and stores, including ongoing efforts to recycle plastic film and scrap metal. in addition, we are piloting a program to recycle tires from our forklifts and other material handling equipment. these efforts divert tons of waste from  landfill. as an added benefit, they also help us reduce waste disposal costs.  in  , to help us divert waste from landfill  while also supporting the communities we serve, we continued programs to donate unsellable merchandise to local nonprofits.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyminimizing waste  offices small changes in how we operate our offices also have a positive impact  on the planet.  examples of initiatives we had in place in  : • we continued to adapt our internal collaboration and reporting processes to use digital tools instead of paper. one such change to our printing process initiated in   is expected to eliminate more than   tons of paper use annually.  • generally, when we do print, we try to minimize environmental impact by using paper that has postconsumer content; setting printers to print double-sided; and using large-capacity, refurbished toner cartridges that result in less plastic, steel, aluminum, and rubber waste as compared to traditional toners. we also have a program to recycle office paper.  • in the café at our corporate office, we provide flatware and utensils that are reusable or compostable, and we encourage the use of reusable plates as well. we also supply deskside recycling bins and provide convenient organic waste and single-stream recycling receptacles in common areas.  • the majority of our associates receive electronic paychecks, which reduces paper use.  • hydration stations are available to reduce single-use plastic bottle waste.  • an e-waste recycling program handles damaged or obsolete electronic equipment. • at our buying offices, we have programs to repurpose fabric scraps and donate product samples to local charities when possible.       corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenvironmental sustainability in the supply chain  much of the apparel, footwear, accessories, and home- related merchandise sold in our stores is purchased from suppliers after they have been produced to other retailers’ specifications. this creates a challenge when we try to influence our upstream scope   emissions. however, in support of our ambition to reach net-zero ghg emissions by   or sooner, we are continuing to examine scope   emissions that occur in our supply chain.  in terms of environmental compliance in our supply  chain, we require that vendors sell us only products that comply with applicable laws, including those related to environmental protection and product safety; we will not knowingly purchase products made in violation of established environmental or consumer product safety requirements.  additionally, we maintain a large supply chain with a  broad network of suppliers to give us flexibility in the event that any of our individual suppliers are impaired by climate-related issues.  additional details are available in the “conducting  business ethically” chapter of this report.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethically conducting business ethically     corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyintroduction  ethical business practices are critically  important to ross and can be seen in the way we treat our constituents— from customers and associates to vendors and investors.  we are dedicated to operating with high standards of  integrity and transparency, and adhering to policies and processes designed and implemented to drive towards meeting these standards.  ross’ corporate governance practices and policies have  been developed with those high standards in mind. these policies highlight the company’s governing principles and expectations regarding business ethics for ross executives, associates, and business partners.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyour approach to sourcing and human rights our commitment to corporate social  responsibility extends to our supply chain and the vendors we work with throughout the world.  ross supports responsible business practices and  human rights throughout our supply chain. vendors, manufacturers, and other company business partners are required to comply with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws relating to the manufacture and production of products sold to ross, including laws relating to:  • labor compensation;  • working conditions; • child, slave, prison, or forced labor;  • environmental protection; • product safety;  • corruption or bribery (including foreign  corrupt practices);  • building and working safety conditions; and  • similar obligations.  to the extent contractors or subcontractors are involved in the production of goods supplied to ross, vendors must require that these parties are similarly compliant with ross’ vendor code of conduct.  ross’ standards and requirements related to sourcing  and human rights are incorporated in various company documents, including ross’ code of business conduct and ethics, vendor compliance manual, purchase orders, vendor compliance and indemnity agreements, and buying agent agreements. ross’ standards and requirements related to human rights are also designed to comport with applicable universal declaration of human rights (udhr) and international labor organization (ilo) standards. for more information, refer to our vendor compliance manual and our code of business conduct and ethics, which are located on our partners website and in the corporate governance   section of our website, respectively.  we closely monitor evolving issues throughout the world  to promote adherence by our suppliers and business partners to our policies and commitments, as well as to federal, state, and local laws. ross will not knowingly purchase products manufactured using child, slave, prison, or forced labor, or where workers are not provided wages or safe working environments as required by law. additionally, we will not knowingly purchase products made in violation of established environmental or consumer product safety requirements.  if we become aware of a vendor's non-compliance  with ross' requirements or procedures, including any applicable local, national, or international labor or human trafficking laws, we will take appropriate responsive action, which can include suspending the vendor's shipments and/or terminating the business relationship.       corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyresponsible sourcing  beyond communicating our standards and requirements  related to sourcing and human rights in various company documents, ross dedicates significant resources and drives processes to promote responsible sourcing.  the majority of the apparel, footwear, accessories, and  home-related products sold in our stores are purchased from suppliers after they have been produced to other retailers’ specifications. though ross does not have direct control over the manufacturing processes for these products, we require suppliers to uphold our ethical standards. some products are ordered and imported directly through  international buying agents or certain overseas vendors. for these items, we have additional processes and requirements in place to monitor and enforce compliance.  to start, we communicate our standards and requirements,  and provide training to vendors, buyers, and overseas buying agents during our purchasing processes. we provide initial training to new associates, as well as ongoing training and updates to buyers and other associates involved in our product sourcing. further, we regularly monitor and assess our supply chain for compliance related to product safety, labor laws, and human-trafficking concerns.  in addition, we maintain a social compliance program  intended to promote compliance with our vendor code of conduct, which requires adherence to local labor, safety, and environmental laws. the program employs numerous resources, including inspections conducted by buying agents and audits conducted by leading third-party auditors. those resources not only proactively engage and advise vendors on maintaining compliant sourcing practices, but also, where appropriate, are utilized to encourage remediation and corrective actions. in  , over  ,  supplier inspections and audits were  conducted under the social compliance program. during their reviews. ross’ third-party auditors or buying agent  teams directly conducted or reviewed inspections or audits from accredited sources. additionally, members of our internal compliance team supervised buying agents and third-party auditors as they conducted select inspections and audits in multiple countries. ross-directed third-party audits and buying agent  inspections require a physical review of manufacturing factories, a review of factory records and certifications, plus interviews with factory workers. ross compliance associates review reports from these audits and inspections, and, when relevant, track corrective action.where we become aware that a vendor or its manufacturing factory is out of compliance, we take appropriate responsive action, which can include suspending all merchandise shipments from the offending vendor and/or terminating the business relationship. on an on-going basis, ross monitors and addresses  emerging compliance concerns through our partnerships with industry trade associations (e.g., american apparel & footwear association, national retail federation, and retail industry leaders association), and our consultations with our legal counsels and international trade experts. we continue to enhance our compliance approach consistent with evolving risk and industry standards. supplier diversity we care about sourcing goods and services from a diverse set of suppliers. through our participation and membership in organizations such as the national minority supplier development council (nmsdc), the women’s business enterprise national council (wbenc), and the national lgbt chamber of commerce, we show our support for diverse supplier communities.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyproduct safety ross is committed to the sale of safe  products in our stores. through various vendor-facing documents (e.g., purchase  order, vendor compliance manual, and indemnification agreement), we require our vendors to provide products that comply with applicable federal, state, and local statutes, rules, and regulations. additionally, we reference relevant legislation and  safety standards when designing our buying and selling strategies. although ross does not buy or sell hazardous chemicals, we recognize that some consumer products may contain natural components and synthetic chemicals as ingredients. to protect the safety of our customers, we require that vendors’ products comply with the federal hazardous substances act and any corresponding state laws. these laws mandate proper labeling, warning requirements, and product testing.  children’s products are subject to rigorous requirements,  including the consumer product safety improvement act (cpsia). compliance with the cpsia is strictly enforced by the consumer product safety commission (cpsc). ross requires that vendors of cpsia-impacted products confirm that they meet the cpsc’s requirements.  where ross sources food and cosmetic products  overseas, we require that suppliers submit labeling and ingredients for compliance review and abide by all applicable u.s. food and drug administration (fda) requirements. additionally, we review and confirm that foreign food suppliers meet food safety modernization act (fsma) requirements and corresponding fda regulations.  ross maintains a product recall program that includes  continuous monitoring of customer claims, store incidents, and government recalls. where appropriate, we conduct internal reviews to verify that we follow relevant government/supplier instructions for removal and/or destruction. similarly, as needed, we initiate a product recall for applicable products that fail to meet our safety standards.  in support of our product safety commitment, we require that our vendors comply with our vendor compliance manual. the vendor compliance manual provides an overview of the various requirements applicable to the products we sell and references sources of additional information. a copy of our vendor compliance manual is available at  our partners website.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyevolving issues standards and regulations regarding consumer products and  supply chains are continually changing. ross requires that all of our vendors engage in responsible business practices and uphold human rights throughout our supply chain.  as part of our obligations under section   of the   dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, we conduct an annual investigation where we review and disclose the existence of conflict minerals (specifically tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold) in products we sell. we require suppliers to identify the source of conflict minerals incorporated in or consumed by the manufacturing of products they provide. as necessary, we perform due diligence regarding the source of those minerals. ross’ conflict minerals disclosure is available in the investors section of our website.  we do not specifically seek apparel or other merchandise  containing animal fur. given our opportunistic buying of already manufactured products, products we sell may occasionally contain incidental fur.  ross’ code of conduct specifically prohibits the use of  involuntary or forced labor by vendors and their contractors anywhere in their manufacturing or supply chain. we have zero tolerance for such violations and have taken additional, enhanced efforts to prevent forced labor in our supply chain. this process includes, but is not limited to, vendor communications, vendor monitoring, and factory audits and inspections. we are aware of concerns regarding involuntary or forced labor in the global supply chain, and our program is designed to monitor, address, and take the appropriate corrective action where necessary.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallygovernance and

message from our chairman and ceo a message from  our chairman and ceo q&a with our svp of cr   who we are  target forward: our sustainability strategy  esg priorities  as i reflect on a year that was marked by tremendous  growth and continued volatility, one thing never wavered: the target team’s commitment to care.  our global team of approximately  ,  stepped up to navigate complex challenges, each and every day, finding new ways to care for each other, our guests and our communities. in doing so, they deepened trust and connection with the millions of stakeholders we serve.  and the past year has done more than reinforce target’s ability to meet stakeholders’ evolving needs. the care i see from our team strikes me as both a differentiator in our industry and an outstanding asset in addressing the great social and environmental challenges of our time. applying our business strengths in service to people and the planet is also making our business more innovative and resilient  and positioning us for continued growth. moving target forward    marked another year of rapid growth on top of  ’s record results. we kept investing in our team, who are the key to our success. today, as we continue navigating headwinds, our team is even more closely connected through our culture — and more committed to serving families and communities than ever before.  that ambition — to serve people and bring joy — has been at the heart of our business for   years. it is the foundation of our decades-long legacy of corporate responsibility and sustainable practices, which we built upon in   with the launch of target forward. this latest chapter in our sustainability strategy redefined what it means to apply our size, scale, purpose and values toward benefiting the world around us. and we rigorously organized around our vision: to co-create an equitable and regenerative future for all.  target forward influences every corner of our business, informing how we source and design products, power our operations, select partners, invest in our team and communities, and countless other decisions. and it advances progress on target’s environmental, social and governance  (esg) priorities.  a vision guided by clear priorities  today, we’re taking an even more focused and rigorous approach to esg across our business, including this inaugural esg report, which builds on our long history of corporate responsibility reporting. it reflects our belief that transparency, prioritization, ambitious goal-setting and continual learning are essential to holding ourselves accountable and achieving transformative change. our esg priorities align to our target forward vision, while stakeholder engagement  progress highlights  addressing other topics that are important to us and to our stakeholders, including cybersecurity and governance.  neither our strategy nor goals are designed to be static. as with any ambitious undertaking, we will continually listen, evaluate and adjust as we learn and  respond to evolving dynamics.  results driven by a culture of care  all of these priorities, including our ambition to accelerate opportunity and equity, start with supporting the well-being, health and safety of our team. in  , we invested in ongoing pandemic support, including frontline bonuses; an evolved staffing model meant to provide more stable hours and paychecks; and benefits designed to increase equitable opportunities, including debt-free education assistance. fortune ranked target second among best large companies to work for, and this year, we announced a new starting wage range of $  to $  per hour and expanded access to healthcare benefits to even more of our team and their families.  we built on our long-standing diversity, equity and inclusion (de&i) strategy and deepened our commitments as an anti-racist organization. we’ve long set ambitious, multi-year de&i goals, and we met or exceeded nearly all of our latest round — increasing promotions and reducing turnover for team members of color, while making strides in more diverse representation across the team, especially in our officer ranks. and we’re on-track to meet commitments from our racial equity action and change (reach) committee, including investing $  billion in black-owned businesses by  . we’re proud of our progress and the new connections and commitments we’re making through these efforts, but this work is never finished. as the following pages show, we also advanced on efforts to reduce environmental impact through renewable energy projects, circular design and more. for instance, as we work to become a net zero enterprise by  , we’re driving sustainability and emissions accountability across our supply chain, and we retrofitted our first net zero energy store. our team is designing with more regenerative, recycled or sustainably sourced materials, including in guest-favorite owned brands such as cat & jack, universal  thread and everspring.  bringing our impact to scale  target has entered our third fiscal year since the pandemic began. in that time, we’ve grown by tens of billions of dollars and invested more than ever in our team. we’ve emerged a larger and stronger company, with even more loyal guests turning to target as a source of joy and stability in an ever-evolving world.  that growth translates to greater responsibility — and opportunity. through our esg and target forward commitments, and our perpetual focus on learning and improvement, we remain focused on bringing our impact to scale. and as we connect our bold approach to sustainability to the power of collaboration and a team that is committed to caring, growing and winning together, i am more optimistic than ever about our ability to drive positive outcomes for all.  brian cornell  chairman and ceo    target esg report

oversees our target forward strategy, offers her insights on target forward’s progress to date and how target is striving to reach its bold ambitions.  what’s most exciting about the  target forward strategy a year into the rollout?  i’m delighted that team members see target forward  as a natural extension of our culture. our teams understand that it’s integral to how we strengthen and expand our business with a clear vision for our future.  caring for people and the planet has been central to target’s mission for decades, and target forward builds upon that legacy by establishing tangible, measurable goals aligned against  critical ambitions .  one key to the widespread enthusiasm for target forward is that the vision was wholeheartedly embraced and championed by target’s leadership. they are deeply invested in this strategy and the milestones, enabling target forward to be fully consolidated across our enterprise. by participating in the co-creation and voicing their expectations in execution, our leaders have helped ensure our teams work arm in arm toward our shared organizational success.  this approach has extended across our stakeholder ecosystem, as investors, guests and suppliers have also reacted positively to how we are bringing target forward to life through new and highly impactful programs. what has led to the high  internal engagement?  our target forward strategy was created with input  from team members, partners and communities, as well as insights from guests. this collective approach has made the strategy and work meaningful for all.  given the interconnected target forward framework and goals, it’s nearly impossible for any team to work on the strategy in isolation. team members see how target forward focuses on the issues they care about and are energized by the fact that the actions we are taking today are destined to shape a more sustainable and equitable world tomorrow.  what are some of the biggest  accomplishments stemming from target forward?  i’m encouraged that since its launch only a year ago,  our teams have taken significant steps “forward” with target forward across all three of our ambitions.  one example of how we are designing and elevating sustainable brands is the launch of  target zero , an  initiative to help our guests more easily find hundreds of products across our assortment that create less packaging waste.  with respect to furthering diversity, equity and inclusion (de&i), target now offers a  debt-free  education assistance benefit to our more than   ,  full-time and part-time team members.  in march  , we completed the conversion of our vista, california, store to become target’s first  net zero energy store  – furthering our journey toward  net zero greenhouse gas emissions by  . these are just a few of the ways we are bringing solutions to life that better serve our communities and the environment. dozens of target forward initiatives are underway, and we are in the process of finalizing the roadmaps for others, an effort led by hand-selected teams of experts both within and outside of target. as we remain dedicated to learning through this process, we expect to find the pathway to our goals continuously evolving, based on new information and as we respond to those changing dynamics.  what role do external partners play  in the success of target forward?  target forward hinges on the input and participation  from hundreds of target vendors and suppliers, plus countless organizations we partner with in the communities we serve. to achieve aggressive goals, and to maximize the impact of our efforts at scale, target forward relies on a diverse set of stakeholders. it’s the only way to achieve meaningful social and environmental change.  by seeking differing viewpoints and engaging experts to address challenges and opportunities, target forward is poised to succeed in helping tackle such critical issues as racial equity, plastic waste and climate change.  this community-centric approach is especially important in achieving de&i within our enterprise, and within the community at large. guided by our  racial equity action and change (reach)  committee, we launched the target scholars  program  in partnership with united negro college  fund, which is providing  ,  first-year students at  historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) with $ ,  scholarships, as well as mentoring and internship opportunities. i’m pleased to report we are  further extending support for these students for the next three years, through graduation.  target forward isn’t just a part of our business. it is our business. and multifaceted partnerships are the linchpins to building a better future for generations to come.  amanda

and address a broad range of risks that could directly or indirectly impact our organization. overseen by our chief legal and risk officer, erm provides regular updates to senior leadership and our board of directors, and specifically the audit & risk committee. we assess climate, forests, water and other natural resource-related risks according to the impact on our business, team members and guests. each risk may impact factors such as sales, price stability, competitive advantage, stores, guests, communities and suppliers, and those impacts may vary in magnitude, duration or dependency. we also assess impact based on existing crisis preparedness or the ability to develop such contingency and resiliency plans.  climate adaptation  as we build out our net zero  goal roadmap, we  will continue to evaluate our climate-related risks and opportunities in line with the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) (see our  tcfd index ). the  physical, financial and transitional risks and opportunities posed by climate change are factored into our management system, assessed for two time horizons ( –  years and  + years), and prioritized

engaged an independent third-party consultant to conduct an assessment in   aligned to the tcfd risks and opportunities taxonomy. as such, a number of transition risks and physical risks were included as part of our assessment. transition risks encompass what may occur as a result of a transition to a low-carbon economy, and physical risks include both acute and chronic risks, such as natural  disasters (acute) and longer-term impacts of a shift toward a warming climate (chronic). opportunities considered relate to target’s efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  we disclose the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities within our annual  cdp climate  response and leverage what we learn to advance  our climate mitigation and resilience strategies. we will also continue to develop our own reporting based on best practice guidance.  we continue to engage with policymakers to urge climate action, and work with ngos and trade associations such as the  retail

products but may also damage infrastructure, often leading to power outages that can spoil food and render our stores inoperable.  our corporate monitoring center identifies man-made or natural disaster risks, enabling us to identify and develop responses to material threats. when climate-related events occur, our risk systems enable a quick response by accounting for team members using mass

target forward strategy.  water is essential to our agricultural materials for  food, textile products and manufacturing, and in the operation of every target facility. access to clean water is also a fundamental need for guests and communities all along our value chain, and we are committed to help build water resiliency in the areas where we operate so this need can always be met.  identifying and managing  water risks  when developing our management strategy, we  first identify water-related risks  that may have a  financial or strategic impact on our business and/ or communities where we operate. we focus on addressing high-priority areas, products and processes to safeguard freshwater quality, quantity and access. in the u.s., this is particularly important along the west coast — where water scarcity   is a significant issue — and  in the northeast where our greatest impacts relate to water quality. since  , we have been guided by our  freshwater stewardship approach .  annually, we use the wri’s aqueduct tool  to  understand water risk for both domestic and international facilities. one key finding from our latest assessment was that quantity and quality are issues we should continue to monitor and work to mitigate through increasingly robust measures.  in domestic locations, we are using the insights from this assessment to inform our latest water goals and to accelerate efforts in the highest-risk watersheds, identifying priority areas of impact based on withdrawals in water-stressed   areas.  this will help us focus efforts at facilities where there’s current and/or future potential for higher water risk.  in our manufacturing supply chain, this information is incorporated into a hotspot mapping exercise, alongside  higg fem  data. this helps us assess  their environmental footprint and prioritize which supply chain locations to focus on for programs like apparel impact institute (aii)’s clean by design. advancing target forward   through water security  securing water resources is a key consideration  across both our sustainable brands and waste elimination pillars. only by conserving water sources can we deliver sustainably sourced materials and operations that protect, sustain and restore nature.  we draw on key partnerships to direct efforts and reduce our impact, with a strategic focus on:  • food and fiber  in our raw material supply chain.  • textile and apparel factories in priority  watersheds in our manufacturing supply chain.  • water risk reduction and stormwater management in direct operations, supporting resilience and collective water security   in the  communities we serve.  in identifying water risks and water-stressed regions where we operate, we will begin to set new value chain goals that reflect the context of our water stewardship approach, as well as our understanding of setting targets around the nexus between climate, water and biodiversity. water use in our operations  while we work on developing new science-based contextual water goals in connection with target forward, we continue to operate under the principles originally outlined in our  freshwater  stewardship approach  to guide our ongoing work.  direct operations  across our stores, supply chain facilities and headquarters locations, we’re acting to reduce water scarcity and improve water quality outcomes.  target is recognized for maintaining best practices in managing stormwater and the quality of water leaving our sites. many of our facilities have stormwater management systems in place, and we partner with local organizations to improve infrastructure and benefit local watersheds.  we are also refining our salt application practices to reduce the amount of chloride entering local water bodies. target has many sites where salt is used to maintain safety during adverse weather conditions for guests and team members during the winter. to address any impacts the salt may have on local lakes and rivers, we refreshed our training at our stores, supply chain facilities and other sites that experience snow events. the training, which includes application techniques and disposal methods, is based on smart salting techniques developed by the  minnesota  pollution control agency . we will continue to evolve  our approach as new practices, techniques and equipment are developed.     water risk refers to the possibility of an entity experiencing a water-related challenge (e.g., water scarcity, water stress, flooding, infrastructure decay, drought). source: ceo water mandate     water scarcity refers to the volumetric abundance, or lack thereof, of freshwater resources. source: ceo water mandate     water stress refers to the ability, or lack thereof, to meet human and ecological demand for freshwater. it considers several aspects, including water availability, quality and accessibility. source: ceo water mandate     water security refers to the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being and socioeconomic development, for ensuring   protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability. source: ipcc wgii sixth assessment report   target esg report

identify properties that may have possible leaks or need plumbing repairs. at many locations where landscapes are irrigated, we use hydropoint smart controllers to water plants only when necessary, find underground leaks when they occur, and to pause irrigation when it’s raining or rainfall has been sufficient.  we are now exploring new goals that align with our stewardship approach. as we develop the next phase of our strategy, water stress and other water risks will be incorporated to determine priority projects and areas.  products  we are taking steps to reduce the impact of our product portfolio and production techniques on vulnerable water resources.  target is an associate member of the microfibre  consortium , which facilitates development of  practical solutions to minimize fiber fragmentation and environmental releases from textile manufacturing and the product life cycle. we have also supported  oceanwise  microplastics research by funding a  cohort through

greater los angeles (uwgla)  to  support its cutting-edge, collaborative programs, impacting the lives of thousands of angelenos experiencing homelessness each year by building faster and more cost-effectively. through the affordable housing initiative (ahi), the uwgla aims to increase access to affordable rental units for those experiencing being at risk of homelessness. all of the properties developed will have a service partner to provide case management and stabilizing services such as mental health services, financial literacy, drug treatment, childcare or workforce training programs.  our local team members often know the needs of their own communities best; we work directly with our store and supply chain leaders to empower them with the resources and tools to make a local impact. through our community engagement funds and giftcard programs, store and supply chain leaders can directly support local initiatives, nonprofits and organizations that are addressing critical needs in their neighborhoods ranging from social justice to workforce development.  team member engagement  our local teams are empowered to drive community impact through volunteerism and pro bono efforts. our team members are committed to making our communities a better place and typically donate around one million hours of volunteer service every year, supporting the local causes they care about. even with the unique challenges to in-person volunteering posed by covid- , we were still able to contribute almost  ,  hours of in-person volunteering in  . team members served as election judges, participated in our pop-up food and essential giveaway events in response to civil unrest and took part in a variety of virtual opportunities.  our team members are generous with their time throughout the year, but they make a particular difference at key awareness events such as earth month, national volunteer week,  /  day of service, our annual giving campaign and martin luther king, jr. day of service.  to empower team members to use their skills and talents to address unmet needs in the community — and help with rebuilding efforts following the murder of george floyd — we launched a pro bono consulting service for bipoc-owned small businesses in the twin cities. in less than one year, we delivered more than  ,  hours of pro bono support, and in  , the program was extended to atlanta, chicago and the bay area. looking ahead, we plan to deliver at least  ,  hours of pro bono support every year.  finally, our headquarters-based legal team provides hundreds of hours of pro bono legal advice to individuals and organizations, offering guidance on housing law and immigration, and helping low-income individuals to start businesses. in  , at least half of our legal professionals participated in pro bono activities. cross-enterprise collaboration  going beyond philanthropy and team member engagement, our community vitality team works closely with other teams across the enterprise — from real estate and assets protection to government affairs — to support community impact.  target in action  engaging with  and listening to black communities  we’ve long been proactive when it comes to  engaging with black communities across the country, but in the wake of george floyd’s murder, the corporate responsibility and guest insights teams sought additional feedback to identify what more we could do. in partnership with store team members of color in markets including atlanta, chicago, los angeles, oakland and washington, d.c., we have:  • focused our work in predominantly black communities that have not just been acutely impacted by recent traumas but by decades, even centuries, of social injustice.  • listened to more than   individuals in one-on-one meetings and small groups, and via feedback from surveys. for example, when we open a new store, the team engages with local stakeholders to identify ways that we can support the neighborhood, such as local hiring events and celebrating what’s unique in the community.  • built trust with stakeholders critical to our business success in these markets, including guests, team members, government officials, small businesses and community organizations working to undo systemic racism and its impacts on black americans.  • identified the needs of these communities, from meeting basic needs to supporting the vitality of small businesses to supporting the pipeline of black team members.  • made investments and developed programs and partnerships based on our community engagement and understanding of what the community thinks target’s role at the local level should be.  by taking time to listen closely to these communities, we were able to identify trusted community partners to support philanthropically and drive team member engagement.    target esg report          introduction environmental social governance indexes and glossary community  social overview

colleagues and our guests, modeling a strong ethical culture through their everyday decisions and actions.  code of ethics  team members are required to follow applicable laws, target policies and our  code of ethics . they  are expected to report any actual or suspected violations, to which target will respond promptly and appropriately. the code of ethics outlines team members’ duty to also report any conflicts of interest immediately if they arise, and select team members must complete target’s conflicts of interest statement annually. our board members have a separate code of ethics, contained within our  corporate  governance guidelines , which is tailored to their  unique role. new members participate in an orientation program that covers different business aspects, including esg-related activities.  business partner code of conduct  because the actions of our suppliers and business partners reflect directly on target, we expect them to share our commitment to the fundamental principles of respect for human rights and environmental stewardship. our  business  partner code of conduct  (formerly vendor code  of conduct) communicates this expectation and, in  , we updated it to include equity and inclusion initiatives. suppliers must conduct their business with a high level of integrity and maintain transparent and accurate records. violations of the business partner code of conduct could result in an end to the business relationship with target.  ethics and compliance training  we provide team members with guidance on ethics and compliance responsibilities relevant to their roles. mandatory training is delivered during onboarding and then annually to reinforce these responsibilities.  we offer trainings covering key topics like anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, government interactions, anti-competitive behavior, environment, food safety and privacy. we also hold trainings on employment compliance, tailored to specific

communities, including women, people of particular faiths, people with disabilities and people in the bipoc and lgbtqia+ communities. we condemn all hate, racism and violence, and have introduced anti-racism experiences, immersions and trainings for all team members.  anti-bribery and corruption  we do not tolerate unethical or illegal business practices. our code of ethics and anti-bribery policy provide guidance that all team members must understand and follow. we strive to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and require similar compliance from vendors, suppliers, contractors, subcontractors and their agents. team members who interact with government officials receive additional training to reinforce our anti-bribery policies and practices.  anti-competitive behavior  we believe that, by complying with competition and antitrust laws, we support free and fair competition between companies. our antitrust policy requires team members to comply with applicable laws and prohibits them from making agreements that restrain competition. transparency and reporting  to achieve transformative change, we believe target must carefully manage and measure our performance against tangible goals and publicly report on our progress. staying accountable for impacts and actions is how we maintain the trust of our suppliers, guests, team members, shareholders and partners. all target stakeholders are engaged and involved in our esg commitments and responsibilities.  we have been sharing our corporate

standards of vendor engagement (sove) ,  which outlines our expectations for vendors and serves as the anchor for embedding human rights throughout our supply chain, alongside our  labor  and human rights policies .  these core documents define the scope of our vendors’ ethical operations obligations.  additionally, applying target’s sove  is a  detailed guidebook on target’s expectations for supply chain human rights, as well as environmental standards we expect from suppliers, and has been made available to vendors in   different languages. we expect all our domestic and international

safety, labor and employment.  grievances  we are committed to providing target team members and workers in our supply chain with access to effective grievance mechanisms. we expect our business partners to share any concerns of potential misconduct so that we can investigate and address concerns promptly. in  , we partnered with human rights consultancy  article one  to create an in- depth training experience for our sourcing team members worldwide. this is intended to deepen their understanding of human rights issues and to recognize the importance of having effective grievance mechanisms in place for all workers in our supply chain.  our ethics and responsible sourcing and sustainability teams conduct ethics training with business partners in many parts of the world. the training promotes the  target integrity hotline ,  a channel available to all team members and supplier workers for confidentially reporting issues related to our sove; the call is free and handled by an independent third party, and local language interpreters are available. we do not share or publish specific grievances or specific issues raised and do not tolerate any retaliation against any team member who reports in good faith. our suppliers should also maintain effective grievance mechanisms for workers, aligned with the un guiding principles on business and human rights. during  , we distributed information on accessing and engaging with target’s integrity hotline to all factory and supplier locations. target continues to explore opportunities to increase accessibility to reporting options and drive comfort in using the reporting options provided.  in the event that a grievance is raised, target will thoroughly investigate all issues and manage them to closure through

rights  abiding by conflict minerals rules  our conflict minerals compliance program is part  of our overall effort to reduce the risk of human rights abuse in our supply chain. we encourage our vendors to use smelters and refiners that are certified as compliant with established conflict minerals standards.  target supports the humanitarian goals of the conflict minerals rules,   and annually conducts  a country of origin inquiry covering all product categories for owned brands or exclusive brands that we believe could contain tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (collectively known as “ tg”). in  , the product categories we surveyed included:  • apparel and home textiles.  • electronics, lighting, kitchenware and small appliances.  • home improvement and automotive.  • footwear and luggage.  • accessories, jewelry and watches.  • furniture, home décor, bath and seasonal merchandise.  • lawn and garden.  • health and beauty products.  • toys, sporting goods and pet supplies.  • paper, office, stationery and scrapbooking. as outlined in our conflict minerals policy , target  will not knowingly purchase or sell any owned or exclusive brand product containing  tg that finances armed conflict in the democratic republic of congo (drc) and its adjoining regions. our vendors must adopt a  tg sourcing policy that is consistent with ours and with guidance from the  organisation for economic co-operation and  development (oecd) . we also require that vendors  report on the standard form developed by the  responsible minerals initiative (rmi) .  target maintains the right to audit suppliers on responsible  tg sourcing. in  , we surveyed   vendors of owned and exclusive brand products in categories that might contain  tg, receiving responses from  % of them. we encourage vendors to identify and source from smelters and refiners certified by the rmi as “conformant.”   of the   smelters and refiners identified by surveyed vendors that provided product-level information met this status.  target could only determine the smelters and refiners that processed a portion of the  tg contained in its potentially in-scope products. as such, while none of the necessary  tg within in-scope products was determined to directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the drc and its adjoining countries, we have not determined that any of our potentially in-scope products are “drc conflict free.” audits and continuous  improvement  because we believe in making a collective impact,  we value common or shared audit programs, addressing issues that are too big for any one company to tackle alone through collaboration with others.  our responsible sourcing and sustainability audit program covers all facilities   that manufacture or  convert raw materials into:  • target owned brand products and packaging.  • target exclusive products and packaging.  • target-distributed products and/or nationally branded products and packaging for which target is the importer of record.  our risk-based audit program assesses facility conditions, worker treatment and compensation, hiring processes, environmental practices and compliance with applicable laws and target’s sove. all disclosed manufacturing locations must conduct regular audits and have them approved by our industry-aligned audit protocol. in   and  , the coronavirus pandemic, travel and factory restrictions, and office closures related to covid-  decreased the ability for onsite audits to be conducted in many regions globally.  reflective of the changing industry landscape, target is further evolving its oversight approach to go beyond compliance, including implementing an industry-converged approach to assessment, and introducing more direct worker reporting channels and other real-time insights to understand emerging business and human rights risk. target has also increased our disclosure requirements further back in the supply chain, including requirements about facility disclosure. target maintains the right to conduct unannounced audits of any disclosed locations.  in  , our team delivered   training programs on this industry-converged approach to  ,  internal team members and suppliers — more than  ,  training hours in total. the feedback we received from suppliers is that, by accepting several audit programs, suppliers’ facilities are more proactive in identifying root causes of issues and making improvements that benefit workers.  learn more about our auditing process and  programs  on our website.  we prioritize remediation and continuous improvement but, in some cases, noncompliant audits may result in the cancellation of purchase orders and the termination of business relationships. target will not allow a vendor to use a previously noncompliant factory until the deactivation period has expired and the factory has demonstrated compliance with target’s sove and applicable laws.  in  , we rolled out our first human rights training to key business areas, including merchandising, owned brands, sourcing and corporate responsibility. the training covered an overview of business and human rights and target’s

company’s  mission to deliver great value to our  customers every day. for   years that  mission has remained steadfast, and so  has our commitment to acting as a respon- sible corporate citizen. we believe this is as  important as ever and we focus our efforts  under four key pillars:  /our workplace   /environmental sustainability  /our communities   /responsible business many of our corporate responsibility reporting  initiatives take into consideration various global  standards and reporting frameworks. for example,  we have reviewed and incorporated a number of  relevant human rights standards enunciated by  international organizations, such as the united  nations and the international labour organization,  into our global social compliance program. we also  map our global corporate responsibility report to  certain frameworks, including the global reporting  initiative (gri) standards, the international sustain- ability standards board’s sasb standards, and the  united nations sustainable development goals  (unsdgs). in addition, we have responded to the  cdp climate change questionnaire since  . our global corporate responsibility executive  steering committee reviews and considers our               corporate responsibility efforts from a cross-functional and cross-divisional perspective. in doing so, the  committee, among other things, guides corporate  responsibility strategies to align them with tjx  business priorities, supports our global corporate  responsibility efforts across functions and geogra- phies, facilitates corporate responsibility information  exchange, recommends additional program efforts,  and, through the committee’s executive sponsor,  periodically reports on our progress to the compa- ny’s senior management and board of directors. the  committee is led by a senior executive vice president  (sevp), group president, who, among his other      duties, provides management oversight of tjx’s envi- ronmental, social, and governance (esg) initiatives. we think of our global corporate responsibility  program as ever evolving, and we are pleased to  present our continued progress here. corporate  responsibility has been part of the fabric of who we  are from day one, and we strive to make a mean- ingful impact on the world, with our efforts reflecting  our core values of honesty, integrity, and treating  each other with dignity and respect. “it is clear to us that our commit- ment to continuing to develop and  implement meaningful environ- mental, social, and governance  (esg) practices is as important as  ever. it’s what we believe our cus- tomers, communities, and other  stakeholders expect of us––and  it’s what we demand of ourselves.”  ernie herrman chief executive officer and president /       /      a

what’s right for the company and the broad range of our  stakeholders’ priorities. today’s challenges are many—our world is still struggling with a global  pandemic, social injustice, war, the threat of climate change, and so  much more. it is clear to us that our commitment to continuing to  develop and implement meaningful environmental, social, and gov- ernance (esg) practices is as important as ever. it’s what we believe our  customers, communities, and other stakeholders expect of us—and it’s  what we demand of ourselves.  i am so proud of our ever-evolving global corporate responsibility programming, which has been part of the fabric of  who we are for   years. our reporting is organized around the pillars where we believe we can make a significant  difference for our stakeholders – workplace, communities, environmental sustainability, and responsible business.  our work in these areas helps us contribute towards the ongoing development, implementation, and evolution of  meaningful initiatives and practices across our operations designed to be inclusive and more sustainable and that  demonstrate our commitments and progress to operate our off-price business responsibly. for example, in april  , we announced plans to expand and accelerate our goals as part of our ongoing  environmental sustainability strategy. the new goals focus on climate and energy, waste, and product packaging,  including a plan to achieve net zero emissions in our global operations by  . additionally, we are committed to continuing to build a more inclusive and diverse workplace where our associates  feel welcome, valued, and engaged. in fiscal  , we completed a global inclusion and diversity survey of our  associates and used the findings to help define three core areas of focus for our work moving forward: increase  the representation of diverse associates along our talent pipeline; equip leaders with the tools to support difference  with awareness, fairness, sensitivity, and transparency; and empower all associates to integrate inclusive behaviors,  language, and practices in how we work together and understand our role and responsibility in inclusion. as we work toward making ongoing progress, we expect corporate responsibility will continue to be a valuable  part of how we do business. we look forward to continuing to report on our efforts and progress in our annual  global corporate responsibility report, in addition to the rolling updates on our efforts that we share on tjx.com.  as always, i want t thank our global associates for their

internal diversity trainings to support our recruiting efforts. in fiscal  , leaders across our  recruitment teams participated in unconscious bias training to help us continue creating an inclusive  recruitment process. additionally, we have implemented a new tool in the u.s., canada, and europe in an  effort to reduce potential unconscious biases in job descriptions and other recruitment communications  and to identify language that may inadvertently undermine our inclusion efforts. we also benchmark  periodically against peers to better understand how we can leverage opportunities to expand awareness  of tjx and our available jobs among diverse audiences. we are actively pursuing opportunities to increase minority candidate representation when we recruit for  early career positions. in the u.s., we have enhanced our outreach to historically black colleges and  universities (hbcus) and partner with diverse on-campus organizations for recruitment events. we have  developed and expanded relationships with several non-profit partners focused on increasing opportunities  for underrepresented students, such as leadership enterprise for a diverse america (leda), the posse  foundation, and girls who code. in europe, we recruit from a diverse pool of candidates for our graduate,  placement, and apprenticeship programmes and partner with organizations such as the prince’s trust,  the uk government’s department for work and pensions, and the uwv in the netherlands to create  career opportunities for disadvantaged young people, including many from underrepresented communities.  globally, we continue to broaden our relationships with schools, universities, and smaller colleges to widen  our reach. we are also committed to working toward increasing the representation of diverse candidates in  management-level positions, including people of color, lgbtq+ individuals, people with disabilities, and  women. in certain u.s. markets, we are

more diverse pipeline of talent to support our efforts to improve the diversity at all levels of our  organization. consistent with our inclusion and diversity efforts, in march  , our board approved a policy that, in the  event that our board commences a search for a chief executive officer from outside tjx, or if our manage- ment commences a search for an executive-level role reporting directly to the ceo from outside tjx, the  initial list of candidates will include qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates. if our board or  our management engages a third-party firm for such a search, that firm will be instructed to include qualified  female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates in the initial list of candidates provided to tjx. on-campus recruiting: from their campus to ours historically, several hundred students each year have taken part in tjx internship and co-op programs  operating across our divisions worldwide, in areas including merchandising, finance, human resources,  information technology, store operations, distribution services, and more. we seek candidates who are  curious and have a passion for innovation, relationship building, strategic thinking, and global relations. our merchandising internships and co-ops are coveted among many students, especially those who have  a passion for various aspects of the retail industry. globally, many participants in these programs join us  full-time after completing their college requirements. proudly hiring those who have served in the u.s. military our long-standing commitment to the u.s. armed forces is highlighted by our dedication to hiring veterans  and military service members, including active guard and reserve, as well as their spouses. we value their  strong work

provide employment and training opportunities  to individuals with varying levels of skills and abilities, including those who face barriers to employment or  are in underserved communities. we have developed community outreach strategies to help us foster a  diverse workforce that includes qualified individuals with a breadth of abilities. teams in the u.s. and europe participate in innovative youth programs which offer personal and  professional development opportunities for disadvantaged or vulnerable young people. in fiscal  , tjx  in the u.s. launched a program called community referred associates, which is dedicated to creating  training and employment opportunities for individuals that may have had difficulty with obtaining longer-term  employment opportunities in the past. as part of the program, tjx has partnered with several community-  based organizations to offer temporary,  -day roles focused on job training and aims to transition eligible  participants to a part- or full-time associate. tjx also continues partnering with junior achievement in the  u.s and supports the organization in providing work readiness, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy  skills for young people. through this connection, tjx associates have the opportunity to volunteer in local  junior achievement programs. tjx europe has a long-standing commitment to help vulnerable children and young people achieve their  potential in local communities. in fiscal  , tjx europe launched a partnership with the u.k. government’s  kickstart scheme to support young people aged  -  through six-month work placements and training  at t.k. maxx and homesense stores across england, wales, and scotland. more than   young people  have enrolled in this program since it began in september  , committing to   hours of work experience  and on-the-job skills training per week, coupled with employability training and resources provided in partnership  with the prince’s trust. with a combination of work experience and trainings, the program aims to help young  people secure sustained employment when their kickstart placement ends. to support its field recruitment efforts, our canadian team partners with various organizations through our  find your stride charitable initiative, which aims to help women get the skills and support they need to  move forward. through our partnership with the calgary women in need society, we support the tjx  retail ready program—an eight-week program that provides in-class training, on-the-floor retail experience,  and mock interview support to help prepare women for careers in retail. in the u.s., tjx partners with best buddies international, a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating  opportunities for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. our teams partner closely with  best buddies volunteers and participants to find roles in our t.j. maxx, marshalls, homegoods, sierra,  and homesense

i was becoming more reliant  on my husband to be my only source of a social  life, which was nice of course for a time! however,  it isn’t practical in the long run. i had no sense of  routine or activity, and this played a huge role in  diminishing my mental health. “i had an incredible, life-changing experience on  this programme with the prince’s trust. it really  promoted my physical health and mental well-being, i met some incredible people working in t.k. maxx  which has helped to increase my social life and i have made a best friend for life from this course! since  taking part in the virtual online workshops, i have noticed within myself: increased confidence, public  speaking, and time management. in my personal life i feel that i have gained my independence here in  manchester for the first time. i have been using public transport to get to work but also i was able to get a  train to visit my family for eid celebrations, something i have not been able to do up until now, without the  help of my husband. “i have become so much more confident; i used to be so hesitant to go out. i now have the confidence in  my experiences on programme to put myself out there for other opportunities!” — wardah, get into retail participant with t.k. maxx & homesense, manchester    global corporate responsibility report /       /       career development attracting talent is just the start. at tjx,  we believe our associates are core  to our success and, as such, it is our        responsibility to train and mentor them.  our senior leaders consider teaching  and mentoring an absolute priority to  support the career development of our  associates. training happens throughout the organization  and in a variety of settings, including in our  stores, distribution and processing centers, and  corporate offices. some is formal, through courses offered in our classrooms and virtually, and some is informal,  such as in huddles or through real-time feedback on the job. like so many aspects of our work, training had to  be reimagined with the onset of the covid-  pandemic. it has been important to us to maintain our commit - ment to talent development while navigating changes to our work environments. as a result, we have been  approaching our learning opportunities differently, offering many formal training classes online and connecting  remote associates through virtual formats. no matter the location or format, formal or informal, our career  development initiatives are designed to foster open communication and relationship building, which are both  key parts of our culture. development programs our leadership development toolkit has defined leadership competencies and  cultural factors which help express our organizational values and promote  consistency in leadership development. in fiscal  , we included new leadership  competency and cultural factors focused on inclusion-based values and  behaviors, which we are working to incorporate into our toolkit over the coming  year. we strongly believe that these competencies and factors benefit our  business overall. one of our goals is to foster career growth across the organization, and we  are proud that in fiscal  ,  % of managerial  positions in our stores and  field offices were filled with internal promotions. additionally, we believe that our  development programs support associates in building a career at tjx, and, in  fact,  % of people in managerial  positions around the world have been at the  company for   or more years. our global leadership curriculum is designed to offer a consistent development experience focused  around our leadership competencies and cultural factors. with core and elective courses, this curriculum  helps associates gain skills in communications, achieving results, interpersonal dynamics, and more. we  are currently reviewing and updating the courses to further align our leadership courses with our inclusion  , + attendance in  global leadership  curriculum courses  since   g   global corporate responsibility report /       /       and diversity efforts. since  , the global leadership curriculum has had associate attendance of more  than  ,  across all of our divisions. our aim is to develop the potential of associates at every level, from  hourly associates to management and beyond, so they may enjoy fulfilling careers. this year, additional  programs were added to provide development for higher levels of leadership that focused on successfully  transitioning and taking on new and expanded leadership responsibilities. to further extend the availability of  learning opportunities, we also made available a global online learning library of over  ,  digital, self- paced learning resources. in addition to our global leadership curriculum courses, we offer many other learning and development  opportunities. our global emerging leaders program is designed to help high potential associates at the  managerial level prepare to expand their leadership roles. the process consists of targeted assessments,  review of feedback, and the creation of an individual development plan. once completed, these associates  have the opportunity to participate in the emerging leader action learning, a seven month-long journey  focusing on the skills needed to effectively grow from a leader of others to a leader of leaders. participants  are placed on cross-functional teams, assigned self-directed learning, participate in peer coaching, and  spend time with executives, who share their stories and experiences. the program consists of critical skills  training and business case scenarios, and it culminates in the associate creating a personalized growth  plan. we are also proud to have launched a mentorship pilot in fiscal  , which aims to connect associates  with leaders in our organization and to subsequently foster their development. more senior-level associates may participate in our global strategic leadership program—an  -month,  global development program designed to accelerate leadership readiness. the program offers a variety of  opportunities, including gaining exposure to different leaders, tjx businesses, and business units. participants  receive feedback on their leadership style and interactions throughout the process, with the goal of incorporating  those learnings into their leadership style. participants learn to navigate the organization, build strategic  planning skills, and deepen their understanding of the business and of themselves as leaders. in canada, our goal is to equip, empower, and enable our associates to own their development in partnership  with their manager. we host a national learning calendar that provides virtual workshops focusing on  professional and leadership development, a vast set of online learning offerings, and a digital library. in our  home office and distribution centers, a “one-stop shop” website provides support for building development  plans, learning about our off-price business model, and enhancing personal growth through curated learning  and augmented by storytelling from our associates and leaders. we are excited to bring our “be your best  self” developmental focus to stores this year with a focus on inspirational associate videos, promotion  highlights, and leadership messaging that supports our tuition assistance, scholarship, and other career  development programs. tjx canada also offers targeted training for many new and existing associates to support their deepening  business and leadership capabilities. these programs include manager in training (mit) in our stores and  district offices and tiered onboarding programs in distribution services. our focus on “accessible development  for all” means providing the tools and support associates need to drive their career. “be your best self” is also our learning philosophy in europe. tjx europe aims to enable our associates to  own and drive their development journey, recognizing that this is as unique as each and every one of us.  we offer associates a range of learning and development options to provide skills and off-price knowledge  through workshops, development programs, training, on-the-job learning, and the graduate, placement,  and apprenticeship programmes. we also offer tools for self-learning and provide bespoke coaching for  regional, country, district, store, and assistant managers.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       in addition, tjx europe’s leader in me program is designed to accelerate the leadership readiness of  managers who show potential for more senior roles. associates learn more about themselves as leaders,  as well as how to use these leadership skills in their current roles and for future opportunities. we also  have a senior leadership development program in europe for vice presidents and assistant vice presidents,  which cultivates leaders who champion and bring our distinctive culture to life. the program develops  skills to help leaders thrive in unpredictable circumstances. participants gain insight into themselves as  authentic leaders and gain self-awareness, personal sustainability, and leadership perspective. we recently  expanded this program to include specific workshops on inclusion and diversity. we believe the program  builds stronger, more collaborative teams across the organization and elevates the capability of our senior  leaders. in australia, corporate and processing center associates can participate in the be your best self program,  a self-led curriculum that enables associates to drive their own development. through various tools and  manager support, participants are able to discover new skills and interests to assist them in developing a  career path, whether that means growing in their current role, or exploring opportunities cross-functionally. merchant training and tjx university we are particularly proud of our merchant training programs around the world, which we believe are some  of the best and most respected in the retail industry. our programs are designed to support associates  interested in pursuing careers as merchants and develop them as future leaders in our off-price retail business.  the merchandising career path provides structured growth potential in merchandise planning and allocation  and merchandise buying, as well as potential management opportunities. the path consists of an initial,  intensive training curriculum for a role as an allocation analyst. afterwards, there are ongoing development  opportunities and mentoring throughout the associate’s career. we are also proud to run tjx university, where we offer merchandising associates learning opportunities  through a two-year-long, one-on-one coaching program. the program includes mentoring on negotiation  skills, store exercises, and a curated curriculum to both further their development in their current role and  prepare them for the next step in their careers. the coaching may take place in-person or virtually in a group  learning environment, in our stores, or in the marketplace. the university has a global reach to our merchants  around the world. our focus is to teach a consistent approach to our off-price business model, negotiating  fundamentals, and building strong relationships—all of which have been a critical part of our success. for some of the buyers and merchandising managers identified as having potential to rise to a leadership  level, we offer a specialized learning experience called the off-price leadership center (oplc). it brings  together associates from across our global divisions to get exposure to the critical merchant and leadership  skills necessary for success. oplc’s focus is on understanding the role; integrating strategic, business,  and critical relationship skills; and building a diverse, global leadership perspective. external partnerships in addition to our many internal development opportunities, we have established relationships with a variety of  organizations to offer additional resources and learning. in the u.s., this includes national hispanic  corporate council, catalyst, diversity best practices, pflag, national association of asian american professionals, human rights campaign, and others. our associates also have the opportunity to  participate in programs offered by some of our partner organizations. we belong to conexión in boston,    global corporate responsibility report /       /       massachusetts, and, on a u.s. national level, the partnership. conexión pairs hispanic/latino associates  with a seasoned mentor at organizations in various industries and provides workshops in leadership. the  partnership offers year-long programs in leadership and cultural navigation for associates, as well  as the next generation executive program, a five-month training course. we actively bring together  associate alumni of both programs to build a network that can support participants and encourage  learning. in  , a number of associates had the opportunity to participate in an external leadership  program designed for black executives and early-mid-career managers. additionally, in  , tjx europe  became members of the business disability forum to support our efforts to help those who face barriers to  employment thrive at work. chantae’s story chantae joined tjx in   as a general warehouse associate for  our marmaxx division—first as a temporary hire and promoted to a  full-time associate shortly thereafter. during her time, she demon- strated potential and an eagerness to learn and grow, taking on  multiple roles and finding mentors who believed in her and pushed  her to seek out growth opportunities. as she developed her career,  chantae ultimately made her way to the human resources division,  where she currently serves as learning and development manager  and leads a team of five across three distribution centers. “i came in the door looking for a job and i found a career. so many  people have encouraged me along the way, pushing me to act on  my potential. being part of learning and development has been life  changing—not only for my professional growth but also personally.  i have stepped completely out of my comfort zone, met and built  relationships with lots of great people, and found it really rewarding  to support others’ growth. there is so much talent on our floors.  there’s a world of opportunity at tjx for those who want to find it.” chantae learning & development manager t.j. maxx distribution center charlotte    global corporate responsibility report /       /       our commitment to  inclusion and diversity diversity presents itself in many ways at tjx, inclusion and diversity have  been an important part of who we are  for many years. we view diversity as  inclusive of many facets—race,  ethnicity, age, sexual orientation,  gender identity, ability, experience,  religion, perspectives, and much  more—and we know that a diverse  workforce can help us to think  creatively, remain agile, and,  importantly, be true to our values. we are strongly committed to continuing to  build a more inclusive and diverse workplace  where all our associates feel welcome in  the company, valued for their perspectives  and contributions, and engaged with our  business mission to deliver great value to  our customers every day. we strive to treat  all people with dignity and respect and do  not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or  hate of any kind. these expectations are  reinforced to all associates in our tjx global  code of

who we are as a company, we  are aware that our work in this area is evolving and can be more effective with input from our associates.  we provide opportunities for our associates around the world to share their feedback, thoughts, and  personal experiences with inclusion and diversity at tjx. as such, we have taken time over the past two  years to listen to our associates and re-assess our company-wide inclusion and diversity efforts. over the course of fiscal   and  , we invited our global associates—who numbered more than   ,  at the time, across all facets and functions of our business—to participate in a global inclusion  and diversity survey. while we found the overall results to be encouraging, the data we gathered has  helped us define our global strategy to further support a more inclusive and diverse workplace. to underpin our work in this area, we have expanded our leadership competencies and cultural factors,  which help express our organizational values and promote consistency in leadership development, to in- clude a new leadership competency and cultural factor focused on inclusion-based values and behaviors. by  formally establishing inclusion and diversity as a core organizational principle, we continue to integrate  inclusion into the fabric of who we are as a company. additionally, to continue to hear from our associates, this past year we launched inclusion and diversity  advisory boards in the u.s., europe, and canada. the advisory boards include associates representing  a variety of functions, levels, and backgrounds across our stores, distribution and processing centers, and  corporate offices. advisory board members are expected to provide recommendations and feedback to  support our continuing inclusion and diversity work and guide us in striving to align our programming with  the needs of various associate populations. taken together, these actions are designed to further embed inclusion and diversity within our culture and  business practices. they have helped inform our near-, medium-, and long-term global inclusion and di- versity strategies, plans, and initiatives—including many of the activities we are proud to report on below.  we recognize that as a global company, regional differences may require different approaches; therefore,  as we enhance our global program, we are also empowering our regions across the globe to adjust their  initiatives to meet local needs. areas of focus: increase the representation of diverse associates along our talent pipeline we recognize that having a diverse associate base can help make us a stronger company and  better able to serve our broad base of customers around the world. as we aim to increase the areas of  focuschampioning inclusionour diverse  workforcepay equity    global corporate responsibility report /       /       representation of diverse associates along our talent pipeline, we are working to increase our  efforts to recruit more diverse talent while continuing to focus on providing diverse associates  greater access to development opportunities. to support our recruiting strategies, we continue to build on the training we offer to our talent acquisition  teams, including through educational opportunities focused on inclusion and diversity. we use a tool in  the u.s., canada, and europe designed to help identify and reduce potential unconscious biases  in job descriptions and other recruiting materials. our talent acquisition department has also estab - lished an inclusion and diversity committee that aims to increase proactive outreach to diverse com- munities, engagement with diverse candidates, and awareness and education with internal decision- makers involved in hiring processes. we are actively pursuing opportunities to increase minority candidate representation in early career  positions, and we continue to work to expand the ways we approach our search for early career  professionals. to inspire a broader range of candidates to consider careers at tjx, in fiscal  , we  developed and expanded relationships with several nonprofit partners in the u.s.—such as leadership  enterprise for a diverse america, the posse foundation, bottom line, and thrive scholars—and have  worked with them to support events, career development, and recruitment opportunities for under - represented high school and college students. we have also enhanced our outreach to historically  black colleges and universities (hbcus) and partnerships with diverse on-campus organizations  for recruitment events. we believe these connections can help us create a pipeline of future diverse  talent with tjx. associates at tjx have the opportunity to access an array of development and retention opportunities  internally and through external partnerships. tjx’s global leadership curriculum and our emerging  leaders program are among our strong internal professional development resources. we also have  partnered with community-based non-profit organizations—such as the partnership, conexión, and  a third-party leadership academy designed for black executives and early- to mid-career managers in  the u.s. and europe, and through business in the community in europe—to create access to external  professional development programs for our diverse associates. we are proud of our culture that  prioritizes development and advancement within our organization, as we simultaneously work to  build a more diverse pipeline of talent to support our efforts to increase diversity at all levels of our  organization. equip leaders with the tools to support difference with  awareness, fairness, sensitivity, and transparency to support our efforts to fully integrate inclusion into our culture and business practices, we recognize  that it is important that leaders from the very top and through every level of our organization exemplify  and model a culture of inclusion. we have made it a priority to equip our leaders with the training and  tools needed to better understand and embrace working with those who are different than themselves.  by adding a focus on inclusion to our leadership competencies and cultural factors, we aim to  formalize inclusion as a foundational value that represents who we are as a company and how we  expect our leaders and associates to show up every day. as part of this, we are developing tools to  support leaders across the company in reflecting on and implementing inclusion-based values and  behaviors. in tandem with this process, we are updating our leadership development toolkit to help  leaders across the company deepen their understanding and implementation of inclusion-based  values and behaviors. we are also enhancing our global leadership curriculum to provide our newly    global corporate responsibility report /       /       hired and recently promoted leaders with tools to champion inclusion and encourage, empower, and  engage their direct reports. in addition to providing tools to support their own learning, we are also equipping managers with  resources to help them engage in dialogue with their teams, including support for managers in our  stores and distribution centers, to lead discussions with associates around inclusion, diversity, and  other challenging topics, such as unconscious bias. empower all associates to integrate inclusive behaviors, language, and  practices in how we work together and understand our role and  responsibility in inclusion inclusion is an ongoing journey, and everyone can play a part. for many years, tjx has offered  education to increase associates’ inclusion and diversity awareness. we believe this helps our  associates better understand how to foster a stronger culture of inclusion in the workplace, and  we expect to continue to focus on these foundational education and awareness-building initiatives.  when onboarding new hires, our orientation materials emphasize the high value we place on  inclusion and diversity, and current associates have access to an array of online learning resources.  in fiscal  , we enhanced our education efforts to include an inclusion and diversity awareness  training program, which was completed by thousands of tjx leaders globally, as well as a “standing  for racial justice” webinar series for associates in our u.s. home office. some of our other activities in  this area include rolling out an updated unconscious bias training globally, new inclusion and diversity  trainings and materials in europe, and a speaker series on inclusion and diversity in canada, among  many additional initiatives. to promote awareness and align with best practices, we are also working to continue to encourage  honest conversations and associate feedback. over the past two years, our inclusion and diversity  teams in the u.s., europe, and canada have conducted associate listening sessions and focus  groups to help guide open conversations, solicit input, and grow our collective capacity to be  champions of inclusion. in fiscal  , we launched inclusion & diversity advisory boards in the  u.s., europe, and canada, which are intended to empower cross-functional groups of associates  from our stores, distribution and processing centers, and offices to advise on our current and future  inclusion and diversity work. across various functions within the organization, associates are setting  up committees to better incorporate inclusion and diversity into our everyday work—including in  merchandising, where teams are finding opportunities to use an inclusion and diversity lens on product  assortments as appropriate for our opportunistic buying and off-price business model. this past year we also launched a new global mentorship pilot initiative to foster associates’ devel- opment by connecting them with leaders in our organization. the pilot is focused on associates in  our associate resource groups and includes formal mentoring relationships, informal mentoring,  and facilitated mentoring roundtables that are designed to generate group conversations on topics  that were identified during focus group sessions, including career guidance, executive presence,  self-awareness, and authentic leadership. additionally, in fiscal  , we also launched our new being inclusive framework to support all  associates, including managers and other leaders, in becoming more self-aware, committing to  supporting others, and championing inclusivity. in the u.s., we are bringing this framework to life  through our being inclusive every day initiative that helps leaders facilitate conversations in our  offices, stores, and distribution centers.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       championing inclusion being an inclusive organization—and making associates feel welcome, valued, and engaged at tjx—is  important to us as a company, and we continue in our efforts to model and integrate inclusive behaviors,  languages, and practices through our organization. one of the ways we do this is through our associate  resource groups (args), which we have been proud to champion in the u.s. for many years and are  excited to begin expanding to other regions. tjx’s args are informal yet well organized, and they typically  develop annual business plans that outline their goals and objectives. many args also manage their own  annual operating budgets and have funds available for charitable giving and/or community programs. our  arg groups often host a wide range of events each year, including educational programming for group mem- bers and for the general associate population, volunteer opportunities, social events, and fundraising initiatives. in the u.s., we have   active args that support associate networking, development, and connection.  in fiscal  , tjx launched its newest u.s. arg, the black leadership & associate coalition (blac), to  help foster workplace belonging and build a stronger community for our black associates. other args  in the u.s. aim to support associates with disabilities, members of the lgbtq+ community, multicultural  associates, women, working parents, and members of the u.s. armed forces. we are proud to be expanding our arg program globally. in fiscal  , we piloted our first args in  europe and plan to continue rolling out additional groups in the near future. in europe, our args include  groups dedicated to supporting asian, black, female, disabled, and lgbtq+ communities, in addition to  a group dedicated to wellbeing. europe’s pilot args include associates in corporate offices, processing  centers, and stores and are currently focused on developing their individual priorities, which will help tjx  europe continue to evolve its inclusion and diversity efforts moving forward as consistent with tjx’s global  core areas of focus. in canada, we have set up inclusion and diversity committees for home office asso- ciates, distribution center associates, and store and regional office associates. like args, these commit- tees aim to provide opportunities for associates to share input, generate ideas, and develop annual plans  regarding various inclusion- and diversity-related areas. as in europe, tjx canada’s committees will also  help inform the region’s strategic inclusion and diversity initiatives in support of tjx’s global core areas of focus. tjx is committed to doing our part to continue to support our many types of diverse associates as well  as to foster greater inclusion within our communities. beyond args, in the u.s., we enhanced our paren - tal leave policy for benefits-eligible associates to be more supportive of working parents, and we proudly  offer transgender-inclusive healthcare, services, and transition support for benefits-eligible associates.  we also fly the flags of the countries represented by our associates at our distribution centers; have  a gender-neutral dress code policy; and, when not impacted by covid-  restrictions, typically have a  large presence in annual pride parades. we continue to stand by our   commitment to stand up for  our black associates, customers, and communities, and as we see examples of violence and discrimination,  including against the asian and pacific islander communities and other underrepresented groups, we are  reminded that we need to continue to work toward a better future for all people.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       our

emissions: in our direct operations energy efficiency operations teams in each of our geographies are actively working to manage our energy consumption and  costs, analyze and improve our operational performance, and test potential technologies in the facilities we  operate to help us drive progress against our operational goals. specifically, our tactics include:   / implementing light-emitting diode (led) technologies  /retrofitting lighting and hvac systems in existing stores and distribution centers in certain geographies  /exploring and leveraging utility level incentives and programs we are also exploring new technologies to optimize access and use of our energy data as well as evalu- ating battery energy storage and demand-control ventilation for hvac, which may be applicable across  certain facility types. renewable and low-carbon energy we source low-carbon and renewable energy to further reduce our ghg emissions from electricity con- sumption. some examples of our current sourcing strategies include:  / wholesale power purchase agreements  /on-site power purchase agreements  /electricity supply contracts  / renewable energy credits on-site solar in the u.s., distribution centers in arizona, connecticut, and nevada and select stores in new jersey,  connecticut, new york, massachusetts, and california have installed solar panels, resulting in an estimat- ed $ ,  savings each year. these projects are on buildings we own or where market conditions and  landlord partnerships enable projects.  offsetting in certain geographies, we leverage carbon offsets  to offset emissions resulting from our direct operations  and business travel.  for example, tjx canada has been carbon neutral for its scope   and   and reported scope   (business  travel and waste) emissions from operations for its fourth consecutive year. the team reduced energy  usage and purchased renewable energy credits as well as carbon offsets to support this strategy. in fiscal   , from a combination of projects focused on forest conservation and small-scale hydro-electric gener - ation in countries where we actively source merchandise, tjx canada offset emissions associated with its  operations, business travel, and waste, totaling  ,  metric tons co e. transportation and fuel although tjx does not generally own or lease the vehicles that transport our merchandise, we do include  some emissions in our operational footprint (scope  ) from limited sources, including those where we  directly manage our logistics and distribution, such as in the u.k. and ireland outbound store deliveries  as well as fleet vehicles. together with our partners, we work to increase fuel efficiency and reduce costs,  with the goal of decreasing the impact of our vehicles on the environment. our key strategies for reducing  these emissions include:   global corporate responsibility report /       /       in the u.s. we:   / utilize hybrid cars for a small portion of our fleet vehicles. in the u.k. and ireland, we:  / incorporate a “sustainability” clause in our new logistics agreements, which covers both trucking and store  delivery vehicles and commits both parties to achieving key environmental goals aligned with tjx targets.  / have increased the use of both our longer-semi trailers and our liquified natural gas (lng) tractor  units, resulting in carbon emissions reductions of approximately   metric tons per year.  / support ongoing initiatives including the implementation of fleet analytics and tire pressure monitoring  to deliver incremental fuel efficiency.  /regularly review our delivery schedules to reduce miles traveled, implementing measures such as  reducing empty running, combining store deliveries, and maximizing vehicle sizes. building green we have constructed new buildings and  incorporated environmentally sustainable  features when feasible. for example, our  newly constructed distribution centers  and processing centers are built to include  the addition of onsite solar arrays where  possible. furthermore, when we move into  existing properties, as part of the renovation  process, our design teams typically  consider ways to improve energy efficiency  and water conservation and to develop  recycling infrastructure where feasible.  reducing emissions: in our value chain our focus has historically been on the climate-related impact of our direct operations where we have the  most control over our facilities energy and fuel usage (scope   and scope  ). in addition, we have begun  to evaluate how our commitment to reduce our scope   and   emissions might be extended to certain  scope   emissions sources as well. through a high-level screening of all   scope   emissions categories, we  have begun to develop a preliminary understanding of which of those categories of scope   emissions are rele- vant to our business. we are also making progress in collecting publicly available information about the climate  strategies, reduction targets, and emissions data for some of our largest vendors. these efforts are intended to  help us evaluate our ability to collect data and measure certain sources of emissions from scope   categories.  transportation and fuel our logistics teams worldwide seek out strategies and technology solutions that can help us increase the  efficiency of our logistics and transportation operations and reduce fuel used to transport our merchandise  throughout our distribution network. we strive to conserve fuel, reduce travel time, and decrease the number  of trucks on the road. we use a variety of strategies and technologies to support this initiative, for example,  using modeling software to improve the efficiency of our store delivery network, increasing utilization of trailer  space, and testing new alternative fuel vehicles.  in the u.s., we have opened service centers that are smaller than distribution centers in addition to  using intermodal.  these service centers are located closer to store clusters and designed to improve  the efficiency of our store delivery process. we also utilize these service centers to co-locate our asset  recovery and recycling centers (arrcs) and maximize our delivery trucks’ utilization by backhauling  re-usable and recyclable materials.     global corporate responsibility report /       /       other efforts include:  / we engage directly with our logistics partners and indirectly through third parties (such as u.s.  environmental protection agency’s (epa) smartway transport partnership and natural resource  canada’s fleetsmart program) to identify opportunities to reduce fuel consumption and increase  fuel efficiencies.    /in  ,  % of tjx’s u.s. freight and logistics ton-mileage was with smartway-certified carriers. to  achieve this result, tjx collaborated with carriers to encourage their participation in this program. tjx  requires that all new u.s. carriers are smartway-certified.  /where feasible, we use rail and intermodal for shipping merchandise, which is generally more fuel  efficient and produces fewer emissions than trucking. we estimate that in fiscal  , intermodal  shipping resulted in  ,  fewer metric tons of co e emissions than shipping the same volume  by truck only. in the u.k. and ireland, we work to reduce and conserve fuels in our owned fleet vehicles, and our agree- ment with our carrier for our trucking and store delivery trucks has a “sustainability” clause relating to  achievement of key environmental goals. third-party verification and assurance of emissions data  /in fiscal  ,  % of our global scope   and  % of our global scope  ,                               location-based emissions data are third-party verified.   /our scope   and scope   u.s. and canada ghg inventory data is third-party verified (using  aicpa (at ) standards). this initiative has resulted in tjx obtaining third-party verification for  approximately  % of our global scope   emissions (onsite fuels, refrigerants, and transport  fuels) and an estimated  % of our global scope   emissions (electricity and steam calculated  using location-based emissions factors) for our fiscal   reporting period.  /in europe, our carbon footprint has been assessed by the carbon trust since  . additionally,  since  , we have achieved the carbon trust standard certificate, recognizing our year-on-year  efforts to reduce our environmental impact in the u.k., and since  , the certification has included  our entire scope   and   european operations.  /additionally, we also third-party verify about  % of our scope

through our network of asset recovery and recycling centers (arrcs) to be returned to  distribution centers for reuse. this effort not only was good for the environment, but it also resulted  in nearly $  million in cost avoidance. r   global corporate responsibility report /       /       maximizing reuse and recycling we have many programs across our global business that support our efforts to reuse and recycle our  operational waste in our stores, distribution centers, and home offices. for example, recycling programs  for common items like cardboard, plastic, paper, aluminum, and glass have been introduced across all  geographies. we are working to improve our programs and find new ways to recycle other items, like  polystyrene. one of our efforts involves our asset recovery recycling centers (arrcs). in the u.s., our   arrcs are located within our service centers and have historically served as a central  destination for regional recyclable or reusable store material. select stores send used corrugated cardboard,  plastic, excess hangers, store fixtures, display cases, unused boxes, and other supplies to their local arrc,  where the items are processed for reuse in other stores or recycled. over the years, the flexibility of the arrc organization has enabled us to test new programs as we strive  to increase the types of materials that can be included in our recycling stream. for example, as our global  waste stakeholders have identified polystyrene (styrofoam) as a key area of focus, we have leveraged the  arrc to pilot strategies to improve our management and recycling of polystyrene packaging material.  thanks to efforts like this and many others, we estimate the arrcs have helped divert more than  ,   metric tons of waste from landfills since fiscal  . in europe, the arrc operates as a reuse center for equipment that is not currently required in certain  stores and fulfills other stores equipment needs. the arrc also operates as a distribution and storage  function for non-stock items, such as merchandise protection. /our three distribution centers in ontario, canada, achieved a  % diversion rate.  /in our european processing centers,  we divert approximately  % of waste from landfills and  recycle plastic, wooden pallets, and cardboard that has been backhauled from our stores. decreasing single-use plastics we have regional efforts in place to identify opportunities to remove single-use plastics from our operations  and are working with our suppliers to reduce single-use packaging.  /in the u.s., we have a team who is working to improve the sustainability of the packaging used  for certain products which supports our global goal to shift  % of the packaging for products  developed in-house by our product design team to be reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable  materials by  . read more about our work in this area on our responsible sourcing page.  /in our u.s. distribution centers, we utilize a more easily recycled material and corrugated box insert  for the packaging of liquid products during shipping from distribution centers to stores that has resulted  in an estimated   million fewer plastic bags being used across our distribution network each year.  /in canada, we established a single-use plastics committee in fiscal   comprised of represent- atives across several functional areas who are helping to drive our strategy around this topic. the  group is reviewing where single-use plastics are used in our canadian business and operations, and  exploring and proposing

solutions that support a more circular economy. for example, in cer - tain parts of canada, u.k., and ireland, we have programs in place that support the reuse of clothing,  accessories, shoes, homeware, and more. in canada , we partner with brands for canada at our distribution centers to provide second life for product  by donating unsold clothing, personal care, and household items to people in need through trusted social  service agencies and schools. additionally, in an effort to streamline our store charity donations we have  partnered with habitat for humanity to collect and manage our store donations across canada.  in the u.k. and ireland , our long-running give up clothes for good campaign invites customers  and associates to donate their pre-loved quality fashion and homeware at their local t.k. maxx, which  could be sold by cancer research u.k. to raise funds for research into children’s and young people’s  cancers. as of fiscal  , t.k. maxx associates and customers have donated  .  million bags of  goods. this amounts to  ,  metric tons of pre-loved items diverted from landfill. the initiative not only  benefits the environment because it may keep pre-loved items from going to landfill, but has also raised  millions of pounds for cancer research u.k. for children and young people and enable ireland.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       reducing water consumption although our business operations are not water intensive, we believe reducing water usage is consistent  with both our commitment to environmental sustainability and our low-cost operating philosophy. to that  end, we work to monitor our water usage and identify opportunities to improve water efficiency where  possible across our operations. for instance, our energy management groups in the u.s. and u.k.     monitor water usage across our home office buildings to identify opportunities to conserve water including  time-sensor technologies to control faucets in many of our restrooms. additionally, our tjx vendor code of conduct  strongly encourages our merchandise vendors to  conserve and protect resources, such as water and energy, and also take into consideration environ- mental issues that may impact their local communities. environmental concerns are incorporated into  our merchandise vendor social compliance training materials as well, introducing high-level concepts  of environmental sustainability, like water conservation. our training includes specific cost-saving,  water-conservation recommendations for our suppliers that they may consider implementing at their  production facilities. we plan to continue including similar relevant water facts during future training  sessions. plastics cleanup efforts as part of our efforts, tjx europe has supported a number of projects committed to reducing plastic and  waste including:  /ocean clean up:  a non-profit organization with a mission to clean the world’s oceans of plastic.

responsibility report   global corporate responsibility report delivering real value  to the world tjx is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions worldwide, with seven retail chains operating  nearly  ,  stores in nine countries spanning three continents. as an off-price leader and a fortune    company, we recognize the obligation we have to our key stakeholders – including associates, customers,  communities, vendors, and shareholders – to operate a responsible business. our business dealings and interactions are grounded in our long-held core values of honesty, integrity, and  treating others with dignity and respect. we hold ourselves to high ethical standards and expect our associates  to comply with these standards, which are set forth in the  tjx global code of conduct.  likewise, our vendor  code of conduct sets our expectations of the vendors with whom we do business and whose relationships are  key to our success. we provide periodic training, both formal and informal, to reinforce these expectations. responsible business initiatives at tjx, operating responsibly includes focus in the following areas:   % of board members  are

/       responsible sourcing tjx believes in the importance of responsible  and ethical sourcing in our supply chain. we  strongly value the relationships that we have  developed with our vendors, which are built on a  foundation of honesty, trust, and ethical business  practices. we believe these relationships have  been a key factor in our long-term success.  our responsible sourcing initiatives cover a variety of  evolving areas of interest. these include our long-stand- ing global social compliance program, as well as newer  initiatives related to the environmental impact of certain  products and packaging and chemicals management within our operations.    responsible sourcing and social compliance are tremendously challenging undertakings. our  efforts are rooted in continuous improvement, which we believe can be achieved by making our  commitments clear to our vendors, buying agent(s), and associates; through our auditing  and training efforts; by responding to issues as appropriate for our business; and by contin- uing to assess opportunities to enhance reporting. global social compliance  program our global social compliance program is rooted in our vendor code of conduct, which out- lines our expectations for our vendors. it also includes our expectations for our merchandise  factory monitoring and supplier training program, which is focused where we have more influ- ence in bringing the products to market. this means our auditing and training typically reaches  factories that produce merchandise that we have helped design or develop to be manufactured  just for us. we believe this is where we are most likely to be able to have a meaningful impact.  while we do not own, operate, or control any facilities that manufacture products we sell, we  collaborate closely with our buying agent(s) and international buying offices because they have  strong relationships with local production facilities and are well positioned to reinforce our expec- tations.  how we buy: our  off-price business model tjx is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the u.s. and worldwide. our mission is to deliver  great value to our customers every day. we do this by offering ever-changing selections of high quality, fashion- able, brand name, and designer merchandise at prices generally  % to  % below full-price retailers’ (including  department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day.  , + buying associates ~ ,  vendors   + countries u   global corporate responsibility report /       /       the majority of product we sell in our stores and online is brand-name merchandise. to obtain this merchandise,  we work closely with our vendors and take advantage of a wide variety of opportunities, which can include depart- ment store cancellations, a manufacturer making up too much product, or a closeout deal when a vendor wants  to clear merchandise at the end of a season. there are other ways we bring tremendous value to our customers.  for example, sometimes when what we are seeing in the marketplace is not the right value for our customers,  meaning the right combination of brand, fashion, price, and quality, we may help design or develop merchandise  to be manufactured just for us. on a worldwide basis, in fiscal  , more than  ,  associates in our buying organization sourced product  from a universe of approximately  ,  vendors and more than   countries around the world. as part of tjx’s  purchase order terms and conditions, our merchandise vendors are required to comply with our vendor code  of conduct. the vendor code of conduct requires that goods we sell have been manufactured and shipped in  accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and, including, among other things, a commitment to respect the  rights of the workers who manufacture products for sale in our stores and online. these requirements stand even  if a vendor applies their own code of conduct, monitoring, or ethical sourcing guidelines. our vendors are also  required to ensure that any factories or subcontractors they use comply with our code’s principles. sustainable products and  packaging we are taking initial steps to determine ways that we may reduce the environmental impact of certain products  and product packaging. as we source merchandise, product packaging, and supplies for our own operations,  we may find more opportunities to procure materials with sustainable attributes. as some of our first steps  along this journey:  /we aim to shift  % of the packaging for products developed in-house by our product design team to be  reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable materials by  .  /we have implemented our plan to phase out all phenol-based coatings on paper customer sales receipts in  the u.s. and intend to complete this process in canada by the end of fiscal  .   /by  , we plan to phase out use of pvc in packaging of certain soft home products designed by tjx’s  own fashion and style experts and specifically manufactured for us. this will include certain top-of-bed  styles, easy-care table linens, outdoor seating cushions, and outdoor pillows. in addition to our global targets for certain product packaging, we have developed a framework to define  sustainable product attributes, which includes materials that can be verified by a credible third-party process  or certification. our subject matter experts have compiled a list of preferred sustainable product certifications in  certain product categories that can be used across all of our divisions, globally. examples include forest stew- ardship council (fsc)-certified materials; global recycled standard (grs)-certified products; oeko-tex-certi- fied products; and products made from organic cotton.  some examples of materials we are using with these preferred environmental attributes include:  /we have sourced fsc hangtags where feasible with certain products our style and fashion experts have  designed.  /a significant portion of our price tickets are printed on fsc-certified paper.  /in t.j. maxx and marshalls within the u.s., we have converted some of our gift card styles to be printed on  fsc-certified stock.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       chemicals management since we operate a large, complex, international business, we focus our efforts in areas where we believe we  can have a meaningful impact and that are most feasible for our business model. as we continue to learn and  build our programs in this area, we are exploring ways to manage chemicals of concern that go beyond legal  and regulatory requirements in our operations as well as certain products we sell. chemicals management has been identified as a strategic priority by our global environmental sustainability  committee (gesc), a team of subject matter experts from each of our major geographies who lead the strate- gic direction of our environmental sustainability program, and a sub-committee of that group is leading the as- sessment of potential areas across our global business where we can limit chemicals of concern. teams across  the business support these efforts by developing tactics that support the company’s initiatives and demonstrate  the company’s ongoing progress around chemicals management. chemicals management oversight is led by  our chief risk and compliance officer and our vice president of sustainability, who regularly provide updates  to the sevp , group president, who was asked to lead and oversee tjx’s environmental sustainability initiatives,  among other esg initiatives.  our current approach includes:  /program development including addressing opportunities in:  /business operations  /merchandise and packaging  /industry, expert, and internal collaboration program development to aid in the development of policies limiting chemicals of concern in our operations and in certain products we  sell, we are utilizing the chemical footprint project (cfp) framework, specifically leveraging the management  strategy section to review relevant industry focus areas. late in calendar year  , we published tjx’s chemicals management program. the program out- lines our expectations for vendors and suppliers to reduce or eliminate certain chemicals of concern and also  identifies the initial prioritization of categories where we intend to focus our efforts. we encourage all of tjx’s  suppliers and vendors to become familiar with this program as well as the best practices for safer chemicals  management applicable to their industry and product type. we will continue to evolve our strategy and work  to identify new and expanded policies and commitments where we may further limit the use of chemicals of  concern within our complex off-price business model. we will continue to update tjx’s chemicals management  program as new commitments in this area and additional policies are finalized. initiatives within our business operations phase  :  /we have implemented our plan to phase out all phenol-based coatings

corporate responsibility report /       /       evolving issues bangladesh the tragedies that have taken place in factories in bangladesh are reminders that we must remain vigilant  and continue to monitor whether our policies and practices are adequate and appropriate. worker health  and safety have always been a significant part of tjx’s global social compliance program. our audit programs are based on evolving industry recommendations, including auditing the fire safety prac- tices of factories. we stress the importance of fire safety in our external supplier and internal buyer training  programs and have posted a message about our workplace safety expectations on our vendor intranet site.  our vendor code of conduct includes a statement that expands our requirements for providing safe and  healthy conditions beyond the factory to include any living facilities provided to workers. going forward, we  plan to continue to follow the various initiatives of the retail industry to glean any insights that might enhance  our own global social compliance program. conflict minerals  at tjx, we are committed to complying with the rules and regulations impacting our business, including  those under section   of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, intended  to address violence and human rights abuses in the democratic republic of the congo (the drc) and  adjoining countries. these rules require public companies to determine if they manufacture or contract  to manufacture any products where “conflict minerals” - specifically tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (or  “ tg”) - are necessary to the functionality or production of the product, and if so, whether those minerals  originated in the drc or adjoining countries. companies are required to do additional diligence about the  source and chain of custody of those minerals that may have originated in the covered region to deter - mine if they came from sources that benefited armed forces in the region. as demonstrated by the tjx vendor code of conduct and our global social compliance program, we  believe in responsible sourcing. tjx is many layers removed from the mining, smelting, or refining of any  minerals contained in the products we sell, so we must rely on our vendors to collect current, complete,  and reliable information to comply with these rules. we expect that our affected vendors will not knowingly  supply us with products that include conflict minerals that directly or indirectly benefit armed groups in the  drc or adjoining countries, although we do not discourage responsible sourcing from that region. we  further expect our vendors and buying agent(s) to comply with our requests to provide us with information  and perform due diligence regarding their sourcing of the minerals at issue. we will consider appropriate  remediation steps if we find that a vendor has violated this policy. fur practices  tjx’s businesses around the world are fur-free. our businesses also do not knowingly source goods con- taining angora (rabbit) fibers. from time to time, our businesses may offer products containing shearling,  haircalf, or hide. the process of procuring merchandise for our off-price model is complex, and if an item  containing fur is mistakenly sent to our stores or e-commerce sites, we work quickly to remove the item.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       we are also committed to continuous improvement in the ethical sourcing of products intended for sale  in our businesses, and as part of our ongoing considerations regarding animal welfare, we incorporated  information about our fur practices into our social compliance training in  . importantly, at all times,  tjx is committed to conducting business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,  including but not limited to, animal protection laws. modern slavery statement  (california transparency in supply chains act

efforts of the tjx companies, inc. and  its consolidated subsidiaries to address modern slavery because we take a global approach to modern  slavery compliance. the reporting entities come within our global social compliance program. about our business. tjx is an off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions with nearly  ,  stores  across three continents in nine countries offering a rapidly changing assortment of merchandise. we  source merchandise from a varying and expansive universe of approximately  ,  vendors and more  than   countries. as an off-price retailer, we have a complex global business model that is quite different  from other traditional retailers that, unlike tjx, may own, operate, or control the facilities that manufacture  products sold in their stores and/or may purchase products from a generally consistent vendor base. our  strategies to acquire merchandise are intentionally flexible to allow our buying organization to react to  frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what is acquired as well  as when it is acquired. sometimes, when what we are seeing in the marketplace is not the right value for  our customers, meaning the right combination of brand, fashion, price, and quality, we may help design or  develop merchandise to be manufactured just for us. our commitment. at tjx, we are committed to treating people with dignity, fairness, and respect. both  our tjx global code of conduct, which applies to all of our employees (associates) worldwide, and our  vendor code of conduct, which applies to our merchandise vendors, reflect these principles and prohibit  involuntary or forced labor. we are aware of reports of modern slavery in apparel supply chains and, as  described below, our global social compliance program underscores our efforts to address and mitigate  these risks, and where appropriate, take corrective action. we believe that modern slavery risks in our  own workforce are minimal due to the strength of our internal employment policies and procedures. our global social compliance program. our global social compliance program includes, among  other things, our factory audit program, our vendor code of conduct, our training efforts, and our grievance  mechanisms for vendors. as part of our program including as part of assessing its effectiveness, we regularly  review factory audits performed, remediation efforts taken, and vendor training attendance. our global social  compliance committee, which includes senior leadership, meets on a regular basis to oversee this program  and review trends in social compliance. in addition to our global social compliance committee, we also have a  global corporate responsibility executive steering committee to help guide our global corporate responsibility  strategies and align them with tjx business priorities, oversee corporate responsibility efforts across functions  and geographies, facilitate information exchange, and support enhanced corporate responsibility reporting. this  committee is comprised of senior executives representing functions across the company, including two exec- utive officers reporting directly to the ceo. these executive officers are positioned to update management  and the board on the ongoing work of the committee.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       to help us evaluate and address the risks of modern slavery in our merchandise supply chain, our actions  have included membership in external multi-stakeholder initiatives that share resources and best prac- tices to improve efforts to combat forced labor, including the joint aafa/nrf/rila/usfia forced labor  working group, the responsible business alliance’s responsible labor initiative, retail industry leaders  association (“rila”) responsible sourcing committee, and the american apparel and footwear associ- ation social responsibility committee. tjx is also an ambassador sponsor of the responsible sourcing  network’s yess initiative, which aims to train, support, and enable spinners and mills in the middle tiers of  the supply chain to end forced labor at the raw cotton level. vendor code of conduct. as a condition of conducting business with tjx and as a means of self certifica- tion, our merchandise vendors are required to agree to comply with our vendor code of conduct which  prohibits involuntary or forced labor, including labor obtained through slavery or human trafficking. our  vendor code of conduct further requires that the goods our merchandise vendors sell to us have been  manufactured in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, which include those pertaining to  involuntary labor, forced labor, or human trafficking. it also requires that merchandise vendors ensure that  all subcontractors and any other third parties they use in the production or distribution of goods offered  for sale in our stores comply with the principles described in the vendor code of conduct. hich prohibits  involuntary or forced labor, including labor obtained through slavery or human trafficking. our vendor code  of conduct further requires that the goods our merchandise vendors sell to us have been manufactured  in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, which include those pertaining to involuntary labor,  forced labor, or human trafficking. it also requires that merchandise vendors ensure that all subcontrac- tors and any other third parties they use in the production or distribution of goods offered for sale in our  stores comply with the principles described in the vendor code of conduct. third-party audits. our global social compliance program includes factory auditing. we focus our factory  auditing where we have more influence in bringing the products to market. this means our program typically  reaches factories that produce merchandise that we have helped design or develop to be manufactured just  for us. we focus our auditing efforts on these factories because we believe this is where we are most likely  to be able to have a meaningful impact. we contract with both leading independent auditors (including ul,  intertek, and omega) and other third parties (such as our buying agent) to conduct these social compliance  audits and we also accept audit reports from recognized audit sources, including bsci, wrap , and sedex.  these social compliance audits evaluate and address risks of modern slavery. in fiscal year  , we reviewed  more than  ,  audits. over the last two decades, we have conducted or accepted tens of thousands of  audits. we maintain a global social compliance manual, which is available in seven languages and contains an  audit procedure outline and factory evaluation checklist to help factories better understand our vendor  code of conduct and prepare for audits conducted on our behalf by ul, intertek, and omega. the audits  are conducted on an unannounced basis during specified time windows, where possible, and they are  intended to verify the factory’s compliance with the standards contained in our vendor code of conduct,  including our prohibition of involuntary or forced labor. to this end, factory audits consider, among other  things, whether workers are responsible for any fees associated with their recruitment and evaluate policies  related to passport retention. vendors are expected to cooperate fully with the audits and to provide the  auditors with full access to their facilities, employees, and documentation. factory audits include employee  interviews in order to hear first-hand about worker treatment. we recently enhanced our audit program,  with additional forced labor questions based on recommendations from industry groups. when we accept  factory audit reports from recognized third party audit sources, the audit report is evaluated against our  own internal audit requirements to determine the factory’s audit score. the factory’s score on the initial  audit determines timing for re-assessment, according to a risk-based audit cycle we have developed. our    global corporate responsibility report /       /       policy is to take appropriate steps should we learn that a vendor is failing to meet our standards. these  steps may include remediation, cancellation of purchase orders, or termination of our business relationship. tjx global code of conduct. our tjx global code of conduct prohibits behavior that creates an  intimidating or hostile work environment, and it requires tjx associates to obey all applicable laws and  regulations of the countries in which we operate, including wage and hour rules. in choosing third parties  to work with, our associates are also expected to select those that act with integrity and in a manner con- sistent with the ethical principles stated in our global code of conduct. tjx reviews reported concerns  and takes appropriate action depending on the nature and severity of the violation. training. we provide regular training for associates, including management, involved in the development  and buying of merchandise, as well as cyclical training for our buying agent, certain vendors, and their  factory representatives around the world. typically, we hold an average of  -  training sessions a year,  focusing on various locations around the world that are regionally close to factories included in our factory  monitoring program. among other things, this training provides guidance on recognizing and mitigating  the risks of modern slavery. due to the covid-  global pandemic, we initiated virtual training in fiscal  year  , which continued in fiscal year  . grievance mechanisms. tjx associates are encouraged to raise any concerns without fear of retaliation  and have multiple channels to do so, including an ethics hotline staffed by independent third-party oper - ators. external stakeholders, including vendor personnel, may reach us via any of the phone numbers or  addresses listed by locality on the “contact us” section of our corporate website.  while an overview of our efforts is provided here in

social compliance mirrors our culture, and just as we are committed to honesty, integrity,  and treating others with dignity and respect, we expect those that we do business with to do the same. we  have reviewed and incorporated many of the international human rights standards enunciated by international  bodies, such as the united nations and the international labour organization. our commitment to these  principles is reflected in our vendor code of conduct, which serves as the foundation for our program and  our responsible sourcing initiatives. program oversight our senior vice president (svp), chief risk and compliance officer has responsibility for social compliance  across our global operations, including our global social compliance program. the svp periodically  reports to our board of directors on various aspects of our program, which may include training efforts,  audit results, and other compliance-related topics. our global social compliance program is part of our  ongoing enterprise risk assessment. program management is overseen by the assistant vice president (avp), global social compliance,  who works closely with representatives of our merchandise and purchasing functions across all of tjx’s  businesses and with the global social compliance committee. this committee is comprised of senior  leadership representing the u.s., canada, and europe and

received, and at times incorporated, insights and suggestions from  investors. for our audits conducted by third-party auditors, we have retained and engage with several  organizations that have extensive experience and expertise in the field of ethical sourcing – ul llc,  intertek group plc, and omega compliance ltd. additionally, these groups assist us with program  development, education and training, and compliance monitoring. we are members of the national retail federation, the retail industry leaders association (rila),  ethisphere’s business ethics leadership alliance, boston

auditing portion of our  global social compliance program   where we have more influence in  bringing the products to market. this  means our program typically reaches  factories that produce merchandise  that we have helped design or devel- op just for us. we focus our auditing  efforts on these factories because  we believe this is where we are most  likely to be able to have a meaningful impact. when we source these products, we require  the buying agents and vendors that are involved to identify any active factories that they use,  or intend to use, to produce such merchandise. together with our representatives, ul llc, intertek group plc, and omega  compliance limited, we work closely with our agents and vendors so that  they understand our global social compliance program, our vendor code  of conduct, and our factory auditing process. our internal teams also play  an important role in educating vendors on our program requirements and  encouraging them to make improvements at their facilities, when necessary.  additionally, we have associates that support the program in various buying  offices around the world. our tjx global social compliance manual contains, among other important  guidance, an audit procedure outline and factory evaluation checklist to help  prepare the factory for the audit process. this tool is available in seven languag- es and offers detailed information designed to help agents, vendors, and  factory management in our audit program better understand the expectations  of our vendor code of conduct, as well as our monitoring and corrective  action processes. we require our buying agents to disseminate this manual to  their entire tjx vendor base and have it posted to our vendor website, which  is available to all vendors. factory auditing process factories included in our audit program are required to undergo periodic audits to ensure adherence to  our vendor code of conduct and local laws. we reviewed

to adhere to all quality and ethical requirements outlined  in apsca’s code and standards of professional conduct. the vast majority of audits conducted on  behalf of tjx are by apsca registered auditors (ra), currently the highest apsca achievable level.  we have developed comprehensive compliance program guidelines for our third-party factory auditors  and regularly review and modify these guidelines for consistency with evolving social compliance issues  and trends. factories are expected to cooperate fully with us and our auditors and to provide access to  facilities and documents. these audits generally include one to two full working days at each audited factory, whether in-person or  remote, and include the following components:  /interview with factory management  /policy, payroll, and documentation review, including confirmation that factory management has verified  the ages of job applicants before hiring to protect against potential hiring of child labor  /factory walk-through  /health and safety inspection  /chemical and hazardous materials review, including usage information and verification of material  safety data sheets, chemical safety, and hazardous waste programs  /confidential worker interviews  /debrief with factory management our avp , global social compliance, and certain associates that support our program in buying offices  around the world participate in shadow audits with auditors. shadowing is practiced to gain a better  understanding of the compliance audit process and challenges, and to better aid tjx in our review of both  our audit results and, more broadly, our program’s effectiveness. corrective action and remediation audit reports are reviewed by tjx and assigned a rating of satisfactory, needs improvement, or unsat- isfactory. for factories assessed as satisfactory, our goal is to conduct biennial audits. when a factory  receives a needs improvement or unsatisfactory rating, a corrective action plan (cap) is created and  concerns are discussed by the auditors with factory management. a copy of the cap is provided to  factory management to assist them in resolving any violations or deficiencies detected during the audit.  to encourage collaboration between our buying agents and vendors, a copy of the cap is also forwarded  to both parties’ attention shortly following the audit. tjx receives a copy as well. factory management is  requested to sign the cap to verify their understanding of the findings. for factories with a needs improvement rating, our buying agents or direct vendors are expected to  provide evidence to us that remedial action has been carried out within six months of the audit. however,  where moderate to more serious violations of the vendor code of conduct or the local laws are detected,  meaning the factory has received an unsatisfactory rating, we require that our third-party representatives  re-audit the factory or require a follow-up audit from an accredited, third-party source and aim to complete    global corporate responsibility report /       /       the re-audit within   months. at the conclusion of each audit, factories are notified of the issues found and  of the expectation of remedial action. we expect that continuous improvement is verified during the re-audit. our general goal is that each  re-audit demonstrates measurable improvement from the prior audit. we recognize that if a factory  receives several consecutive noncompliant grades, this pattern may suggest that required remedial action  is not being undertaken. though we strive to work with vendors to address and resolve shortcomings in their operations, under  extreme circumstances, we may conclude that our merchandise can no longer be produced in certain  factories, or that they will be precluded from producing goods for us until they demonstrate that they  have addressed the situation and have put management systems in place to prevent a recurrence. our  preferred approach, however, is to work with vendors whenever possible to address and resolve issues  identified during audits because improving working conditions in factories is an ongoing effort and tjx,  like other retailers, continues to face this challenge. we believe this is preferable to ceasing use of these  factories as it gives us the ability to influence positive change. we believe that this “continuous improve - ment” model is in the interest of the workers in the facilities from which we source goods. there are several issues that we consider to be “zero tolerance” issues: for example, bribery/corruption;  child labor and forced or slave labor; human trafficking; maintaining a facility with all doors and/or exits  locked; use of chemicals banned in the region; and failure to pay wages. if a factory is found to be in  violation of our requirements on these topics, we inform our vendor that it can no longer provide us with  goods made by that factory. encouraging environmental responsibility in keeping with our commitment to protect the environment, audits conducted on behalf of tjx include  a review of factory policies, practices, and procedures concerning the handling of chemicals and other  hazardous waste, and a review of whether the factory is in compliance with applicable environmental laws  and regulations. our vendor code of conduct strongly encourages our vendors to share our commitment  to protecting the environment by operating in a sustainable manner where possible, for example by  conserving and protecting resources, such as water and energy, and taking into consideration environ- mental issues that may impact local communities. our social compliance training program has been  expanded to include coverage of the protection and conservation of water, as well as an overview of the  legal requirements on the use of chemicals and hazardous materials in the regions where products are  both manufactured and sold. training includes case studies to assist vendors and factory management in  better understanding our expectations and our vendor code of conduct requirements in this area.    global corporate responsibility report /       /       social compliance  training we recognize that it is important to  routinely train buying agents, vendors,  and factory management, and we  strongly encourage all new factories  in our factory monitoring program to  participate in such training. typically,  we hold an average of  -  training  sessions a year, focusing on various  locations around the world that are  regionally close to factories included  in our factory monitoring program. in  fiscal  , training sessions were held  remotely due to the covid-   pandemic. these training sessions are conducted by ul representatives in partnership with our assistant  vice president (avp), global social compliance. we believe the presence of our management  at these sessions demonstrates to factory management, buying agent management, and  vendors that tjx is committed to our global social compliance program. over time, our  training sessions have been held in various locations (see map for examples) and have  included the following topics:  /together with our representatives, ul llc, intertek group plc, and omega compliance limited, we work    tjx’s vendor code of conduct and the expectations contained in this code  /local labor laws  /anti-bribery laws (including the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act)  /regulations on chemicals and hazardous materials, material data safety sheets, hazardous waste         management, and required environmental permits  /business ethics  /tjx’s policy against forced and involuntary labor, including slavery and human trafficking  /fire safety  /water conservation recommendations  /tjx’s fur practices  /factory compliance best practices and preventative actions  /case studies to help demonstrate how to embed management remediation systems  /open discussions with vendors and factory management on compliance challenges in addition to the above, we often include targeted training based on geographic or other regional differences  to ensure that we are covering the most pertinent topics for each training session, and we may break into focus  groups to enhance training through shared learning. x   global corporate responsibility report /       /       designated representatives at various buying offices around the globe also provide instruction to vendors and  factory management on our ethical sourcing expectations. we plan to continue to devote resources to these  important training initiatives and to review and update these initiatives as appropriate. associate training tjx associates involved in the development and buying of merchandise are expected to undergo formal social  compliance training biennially. in addition, through informal meetings and discussions, our avp , global social  compliance continues to share our learnings, updating our product development and buying associates on the  requirements of tjx’s global social compliance program. in fiscal  , we began expanding our training efforts through new partnerships with external stakeholders.  through our sponsorship of the responsible sourcing network’s yarn ethically and sustainably sourced (yess)  initiative, we were able to offer associates that support our global social compliance program access to  information sessions about yess’ work assisting mills and spinners in identifying forced labor in their supply  chains. additionally, through our participation in the responsible business alliance’s responsible labor  initiative, associates that support our global social compliance program will have access to forced labor  training modules.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       vendor code of  conduct we expect high ethical standards from anyone with whom we do business. our vendor code  of conduct reflects those high standards, which embrace internationally recognized principles  designed to protect the interests of the workers who manufacture products for sale in our  businesses. these principles have been informed by, and in many instances incorporate,    human rights, labor rights, and anti-corruption standards enunciated by the united nations  and other respected international bodies, such as the international labour organization and  its core standards. we are committed to respecting the rights of all workers, including the  rights of women and children, who can be especially vulnerable in the retail manufacturing  supply chain. acceptance of our vendor code of conduct is part of our purchase order terms and conditions for merchandise  vendors. while the specific requirements contained in the code were developed with merchandise vendors in  mind, we expect all of the companies and individuals with whom we do business to act with integrity and ad- here to the basic principles that underlie each code requirement. those basic principles include a commitment  to act in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations; respect for the human rights and well-being of all  people; and consideration of one’s impact on the environment. as with all of our corporate responsibility programs, we are committed to continuous improvement. with that  in mind, we periodically benchmark our vendor code of conduct against the codes of many industry peers to  better understand the common practices in the industry and identify where our programs are aligned. these  efforts help us prioritize additional areas of focus, and support enhancements made to our vendor code of  conduct, as recently as  . we plan to continue to evaluate further potential amendments we may want to  make in the future. we encourage anyone with questions or concerns relating to our vendor code of conduct to contact us at  complianceofficer@tjx.com. the tjx companies, inc. vendor  code of conduct tjx requires that all products offered for sale in our stores be produced in facilities that meet specific criteria, as  set forth below: compliance with applicable laws

labor our vendors must not use child labor. the term “child” is defined as anyone younger than   years of age (or  younger than   years of age where the law of the country of manufacture allows  -year-olds to work). at all  times our vendors must respect compulsory education laws. workers under the age of   must not perform  hazardous work. forced labor our vendors must not use voluntary or involuntary prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, labor acquired  through slavery or human trafficking, or any forms of involuntary or forced labor. our vendors must not require  workers to surrender any identity papers as a condition of employment; such documents may only be tempo- rarily held to verify a worker’s employment eligibility. our vendors must reimburse their workers for any recruit- ment or hiring fees that are paid. wages and benefits our vendors must abide by all applicable laws relating to wages and benefits, and must pay the legally pre- scribed minimum wage or higher. workers must be provided with a written contract which clearly describes  their employment and wage terms prior to acceptance of employment. our vendors must not make any  deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure. working hours our vendors must not require their employees, on a regularly-scheduled basis, to work in excess of   hours  per week (or fewer hours if prescribed by applicable laws and regulations). all overtime must be voluntary and  must be fully compensated in accordance with the requirements of local law, and except in extraordinary cir - cumstances, employees must be entitled to at least one day of rest in every seven-day period. harassment or abuse our vendors must respect the rights and dignity of their employees. we will not tolerate human rights abuses,  including physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse of workers. discrimination workers must be employed, retained, and compensated based on their ability to perform their jobs, and must  not be discriminated against on the basis of gender, race, color, national origin, religious, ethnic or cultural   global corporate responsibility report /       /       beliefs,

with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, including maintaining  current environmental permits. our vendors must be in compliance with all laws related to the handling, storage,  and disposal of chemicals and other hazardous materials. our vendors must adopt reasonable practices, where  possible, to conserve and protect resources, such as water and energy; and mitigate negative environmental im- pacts to local communities. subcontractors our vendors must ensure that all subcontractors and any other third parties they use in the production or  distribution of goods offered for sale in our stores comply with the principles described in this code of con- duct. additionally, our private label vendors must disclose to tjx’s third-party auditors the names of all such  subcontractors, and third parties before social compliance audits are scheduled. monitoring and compliance tjx or its designated third party auditor or agent shall have the right to monitor and assess compliance with  these principles. our vendors must be transparent and honest in all communications with tjx, our auditors and  agents. a violation of this code of conduct may result in required corrective action, cancellation of purchase  order(s), and/or termination of the business relationship. reporting violations of this code of conduct can be reported through the tjx helpline at tjxethicsline.ethicspoint.com or  by calling (us #)  -tjx-  ( - - ).   global corporate responsibility report /       /       stakeholder  engagement we strongly believe that for our policies and prac- tices to be effective, they must evolve and be  informed by the perspectives of our many stake- holders, including our associates, customers,  investors, and others. therefore, we strive to  maintain an open dialogue with these important  groups to achieve our goals. engaging with our associates we believe associate engagement, relationship building, and our open-door philosophy are key to  maintaining our culture, whether in our stores, distribution centers, or offices around the world. we want  our associates to be informed about our businesses and encouraged to learn and grow through both  formal and informational interactions. we believe these efforts help strengthen our inclusive culture so  associates feel welcome, valued, and engaged. as such, we have many different ways to communicate  with and hear from our associates, which became even more vital as the covid-  pandemic impacted  how we interact in the workplace. as our office associates largely continued to work remotely in fiscal  , our in-person communications  events remained virtual. we were pleased to be able to continue engaging our remote associates through  town hall meetings, state of the company meetings, and ceo updates. additionally, we continued to  publish the thread, our global intranet, and the loop, a weekly e-newsletter, which disseminate an- nouncements and facilitate information and policy sharing; tjx geographic-specific publications, such as  tjxtra in europe; and weekly bulletins in various regions around the globe. yammer, a social media tool  we launched in fiscal   for office associates to share information and engage in virtual discussions,  became more active and helped foster relationship building amidst the pandemic. in our stores, we share important company information with and receive feedback from our associates  through socially distanced team huddles and in-store bulletin boards. these bulletin boards also feature  store news, like volunteer events, fundraising successes, new processes, and more. we also have programs  for associates to share ideas, including thoughts on how to further improve the customer experience, as well  as several in-store programs designed to motivate and reward our associates, stores, and districts.   z   global corporate responsibility report /       /       engaging with our customers our customers are very important to us, and engaging  with them allows us to address their changing prefer - ences, tastes, interests, and concerns. one way we  measure our success is by asking customers to rate  their experience using online customer satisfaction  surveys. based on what we hear from our customers,  we regularly provide store operations management  with feedback regarding store performance so they  may identify opportunities and address issues quickly  – and ultimately improve the in-store experience. this  input also allows us to develop clear customer expe- rience training for store managers, team leaders, and  associates. the data has also helped drive broad  improvements across many of our retail chains, including redesigning floor plans, creating small “shops,”  and changing lighting to better highlight products. we have carefully tested each initiative for how it can  drive excitement about our retail chains and products and continue to help deliver the experience we  know our customers love and have come to expect. additionally, each retail chain has a website that highlights important information (including our covid-   health and wellness protocols), seasonal offerings, store locations, and contact information for customer  service groups, and for some of our retail chains, the ability to shop online. our chains also leverage a variety  of social media channels for customer engagement and real-time feedback on shopping experiences. our engagement efforts are all in place so that we can continue to provide excellent service to our customers. engaging with our investors in addition to our public disclosures and corporate responsibility reporting, we speak regularly with  shareholders throughout each year via investor meetings, conferences, phone calls, and written  correspondence. held mostly in virtual formats in fiscal  , these interactions allow us to engage with  the investor community regarding our company’s financial performance and on environmental, social, and  governance (esg) matters. we listen to our shareholders’ insights and perspectives thoughtfully, considering  what is best for our many stakeholders and our company overall. information security and privacy information security and privacy are very important to tjx. we have many protocols in place that are  designed to help protect the security of our customers’ personal information. the privacy pages on our  retail brand websites describe our privacy policies pertaining to the personal information we collect about  our customers. for many years, we have maintained an information management program, led by our chief risk and  compliance officer (cco) and information risk management director. this program is overseen by tjx’s  information management steering committee, which meets regularly and includes a number of senior    global corporate responsibility report /       /       leaders, including the data protection officer, chief information security officer (ciso), and director of  internal audit. this committee is responsible for developing and overseeing strategies to help tjx’s  information management program enhance the overall privacy, information security, and records  management posture of tjx. our cco and ciso regularly report to the audit committee of our board  of directors. our information management program incorporates several components, including: privacy: our privacy policies address the types of personal information we collect from customers, how  we may use that information, with whom we share that information, how we protect that information, and  how individuals can exercise their rights in regards to their personal information. we don’t generate revenue  by selling personal information. information security: while cyber threats are constantly evolving and no retailer can guarantee perfect  security, we have a multi-faceted approach designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the  personal information that we collect from customers. this approach includes measures like encryption for  certain types of personal information, controls over access to tjx facilities and systems, along with other  threat and risk-based safeguards. records management: our records management program consists of policies, guidelines, and practices  designed to promote both the retention of company records to meet legal and business requirements and  the timely deletion of records and other documents, with particular emphasis on minimizing the retention  of personal information where appropriate. in addition to these components, we perform selected audits and make training available to appropriate  tjx associates. audits: our internal audit team performs audits that address compliance with tjx information security  policies and, along with other teams, reviews certain third-party service providers with respect to their  security practices concerning personal information. associate training: privacy and information security training is made available to appropriate tjx  associates and is tailored to their job functions. this training is often supplemented with other education,  communications, and an internal information management website, all designed to help our associates  understand our expectations in this important area. engaging with our canadian associates one of the ways we engage with our canadian store associates is through the joy  project, which has inspired, motivated, and built associates’ morale. this in-store  program is focused on supporting the integral parts of our culture at tjx canada as  we strive to create an overall positive environment by recognizing store associates  for “spreading joy” through random acts of kindness, such as encouraging a  co-worker for a job well done or assisting a customer. further, in our canadian  distribution centers, our drive program (delivering results, innovation, and  value through engagement) seeks to identify best practices and efficiencies through  in-the-moment and planned conversations between managers and associates. our  goal in both of these programs is to drive the importance of building strong connections  between managers, associates, and customers.    global corporate responsibility report /       /       supplier diversity inclusion and diversity have long been a priority at tjx. the value we place on diversity extends  into all aspects of our organization, including our supplier relationships. our supplier diversity program is dedicated to broadening supplier options for not-for-resale goods and services.  since its inception in  , our program has expanded to help provide additional opportunities to businesses  owned by minorities, women, veterans, lgbtq+ individuals, and persons with disabilities. this, in turn, has  helped us identify suppliers for mutually beneficial relationships and has helped to promote economic development  in our suppliers’ local communities. in fiscal  , we expanded our supplier diversity program into canada and the u.k. and added partnerships  with several regional councils to help us identify certified diverse suppliers in those regions. supporting women-owned businesses for several years, tjx has participated in the corporate mentorship  program with the center for women & enterprise (cwe), a  massachusetts-based organization that pairs qualified companies  with certified women-owned businesses. this is a natural fit as cwe’s  mission of providing opportunities for women in business closely mirrors our efforts to support women in our  own workplace. in fiscal  , cwe identified a mentoring need at iterators llc, an inclusive, women-owned  small business that ensures websites and mobile apps are accessible to individuals with disabilities, and  matched iterators llc with tjx. the mentoring relationship focused on growing iterators llc’s business and  profitability, including how to articulate business value to clients and enhance marketing strategies. aa   global corporate responsibility report /       /       “my tjx mentor’s guidance allowed us to make changes and secure work we might not have sought  before, making our business more sustainable. perhaps the most valuable part for me was hearing my  mentor’s personal stories about business, which showed me how similar we are as humans and made me  more confident in speaking about my business.” jill wilcox, iterators llc supplier requirements  to support tjx’s goal of providing great value to our customers every day, our suppliers must demonstrate: / financial stability / proven history of successful projects / understanding of tjx’s business and practices / ability to provide high-quality, cost-competitive

recognize that  we must remain grounded in the same  principles on which our company was  founded – operating with high levels of  honesty and integrity, and treating others  with dignity and respect. we rely on the  talent and efforts of our associates, as  well as the example set by our leaders,  to help us live these principles every  day and foster the continued success  of our company. engagement with key  stakeholders has informed enhance- ments to our policies, practices, and  disclosures. our board of directors is responsible for over - seeing the business and management of the company. we believe our board should be composed of highly  engaged directors and that the board’s skills and experience be aligned with the changing needs of the company  for current and future business environments. as a global company with hundreds of thousands of associates  and operations on four continents, we consider inclusion and diversity to be part of who we are and core to our  culture. we look for a board that represents a diversity of backgrounds and experience, including as to gender  and race/ethnicity, and that reflects a range of talents, ages, skills, viewpoints, professional experiences,  geographies, and educational backgrounds. director qualifications and   nominations the corporate governance committee recommends to the board individuals to be director nominees who, in  the opinion of the committee, will be committed to the long-term success of our business and the best interests of  our shareholders. the committee considers a range of factors when considering individual candidates, including  personal and professional ethics, integrity, and values; independence; and diversity, including gender, ethnic,  racial, age, and geographic. the committee seeks nominees who have established strong professional reputations with experience in  substantive areas that are important to the long-term success of our complex, global business, such

a long history of strong corporate governance practices and policies. as part of our governance  practices, we are committed to high standards of ethics, which are reflected in the tjx global code of  conduct, code of ethics for tjx executives, director code of business conduct and ethics, and corporate  governance principles. specifically, our global code of conduct, which applies to all associates worldwide as  well as our board of directors, details our basic principles of honesty, integrity, and treating others with dignity  and respect and serves as a guide for ethical business conduct. the code is translated into over   languages,  and we provide periodic training, both formal and informal, to reinforce our expectations. our code of ethics for  tjx executives governs our executive chairman, chief executive officer and president, chief financial officer,  and other senior operating, financial, and legal executives who are also subject to our global code of conduct.  it is designed to ensure integrity in our financial reports and public disclosures. our director code of business  conduct and ethics is designed to promote honest and ethical conduct; compliance with applicable laws, rules,  and regulations; and the avoidance of conflicts of interest for our directors. our corporate governance principles provide expectations and guidelines for our board, such as duties and  expectations of service, including commitment of time, qualifications for independence, evaluation of perfor - mance, framework for meetings, committee structure, stock ownership guidelines, and other elements of our  board governance. each of the committees of our board of directors has a charter that sets forth, among other  things, the purpose and duties and responsibilities of the respective committee. many of the policies outlined in  our corporate governance principles, codes of conduct and ethics, and other governance documents create  an important
