forward: our sustainability strategy  esg priorities  as i reflect on a year that was marked by tremendous  growth and continued volatility, one thing never wavered: the target team’s commitment to care.  our global team of approximately  ,  stepped up to navigate complex challenges, each and every day, finding new ways to care for each other, our guests and our communities. in doing so, they deepened trust and connection with the millions of stakeholders we serve.  and the past year has done more than reinforce target’s ability to meet stakeholders’ evolving needs. the care i see from our team strikes me as both a differentiator in our industry and an outstanding asset in addressing the great social and environmental challenges of our time. applying our business strengths in service to people and the planet is also making our business more innovative and resilient  and positioning us for continued growth. moving target forward    marked another year of rapid growth on top of  ’s record results. we kept investing in our team, who are the key to our success. today, as we continue navigating headwinds, our team is even more closely connected through our culture — and more committed to serving families and communities than ever before.  that ambition — to serve people and bring joy — has been at the heart of our business for   years. it is the foundation of our decades-long legacy of corporate responsibility and sustainable practices, which we built upon in   with the launch of target forward. this latest chapter in our sustainability strategy redefined what it means to apply our size, scale, purpose and values toward benefiting the world around us. and we rigorously organized around our vision: to co-create an equitable and regenerative future for all.  target forward influences every corner of our business, informing how we source and design products, power our operations, select partners, invest in our team and communities, and countless other decisions. and it advances progress on target’s environmental, social and governance  (esg) priorities.  a vision guided by clear priorities  today, we’re taking an even more focused and rigorous approach to esg across our business, including this inaugural esg report, which builds on our long history of corporate responsibility reporting. it reflects our belief that transparency, prioritization, ambitious goal-setting and continual learning are essential to holding ourselves accountable and achieving transformative change. our esg priorities align to our target forward vision, while stakeholder engagement  progress highlights  addressing other topics that are important to us and to our stakeholders, including cybersecurity and governance.  neither our strategy nor goals are designed to be static. as with any ambitious undertaking, we will continually listen, evaluate and adjust as we learn and  respond to evolving dynamics.  results driven by a culture of care  all of these priorities, including our ambition to accelerate opportunity and equity, start with supporting the well-being, health and safety of our team. in  , we invested in ongoing pandemic support, including frontline bonuses; an evolved staffing model meant to provide more stable hours and paychecks; and benefits designed to increase equitable opportunities, including debt-free education assistance. fortune ranked target second among best large companies to work for, and this year, we announced a new starting wage range of $  to $  per hour and expanded access to healthcare benefits to even more of our team and their families.  we built on our long-standing diversity, equity and inclusion (de&i) strategy and deepened our commitments as an anti-racist organization. we’ve long set ambitious, multi-year de&i goals, and we met or exceeded nearly all of our latest round — increasing promotions and reducing turnover for team members of color, while making strides in more diverse representation across the team, especially in our officer ranks. and we’re on-track to meet commitments from our racial equity action and change (reach) committee, including investing $  billion in black-owned businesses by  . we’re proud of our progress and the new connections and commitments we’re making through these efforts, but this work is never finished. as the following pages show, we also advanced on efforts to reduce environmental impact through renewable energy projects, circular design and more. for instance, as we work to become a net zero enterprise by  , we’re driving sustainability and emissions accountability across our supply chain, and we retrofitted our first net zero energy store. our team is designing with more regenerative, recycled or sustainably sourced materials, including in guest-favorite owned brands such as cat & jack, universal  thread and everspring.  bringing our impact to scale  target has entered our third fiscal year since the pandemic began. in that time, we’ve grown by tens of billions of dollars and invested more than ever in our team. we’ve emerged a larger and stronger company, with even more loyal guests turning to target as a source of joy and stability in an ever-evolving world.  that growth translates to greater responsibility — and opportunity. through our esg and target forward commitments, and our perpetual focus on learning and improvement, we remain focused on bringing our impact to scale. and as we connect our bold approach to sustainability to the power of collaboration and a team that is committed to caring, growing and winning together, i am more optimistic than ever about our ability to drive positive outcomes for all.  brian cornell  chairman and ceo    target esg report

strategy  esg priorities  stakeholder engagement  progress highlights governance indexes and glossary  unveiled in june  , target forward is our vision  for co-creating an equitable and regenerative future together with our guests, partners and communities. amanda nusz, who oversees our target forward strategy, offers her insights on target forward’s progress to date and how target is striving to reach its bold ambitions.  what’s most exciting about the  target forward strategy a year into the rollout?  i’m delighted that team members see target forward  as a natural extension of our culture. our teams understand that it’s integral to how we strengthen and expand our business with a clear vision for our future.  caring for people and the planet has been central to target’s mission for decades, and target forward builds upon that legacy by establishing tangible, measurable goals aligned against  critical ambitions .  one key to the widespread enthusiasm for target forward is that the vision was wholeheartedly embraced and championed by target’s leadership. they are deeply invested in this strategy and the milestones, enabling target forward to be fully consolidated across our enterprise. by participating in the co-creation and voicing their expectations in execution, our leaders have helped ensure our teams work arm in arm toward our shared organizational success.  this approach has extended across our stakeholder ecosystem, as investors, guests and suppliers have also reacted positively to how we are bringing target forward to life through new and highly impactful programs. what has led to the high  internal engagement?  our target forward strategy was created with input  from team members, partners and communities, as well as insights from guests. this collective approach has made the strategy and work meaningful for all.  given the interconnected target forward framework and goals, it’s nearly impossible for any team to work on the strategy in isolation. team members see how target forward focuses on the issues they care about and are energized by the fact that the actions we are taking today are destined to shape a more sustainable and equitable world tomorrow.  what are some of the biggest  accomplishments stemming from target forward?  i’m encouraged that since its launch only a year ago,  our teams have taken significant steps “forward” with target forward across all three of our ambitions.  one example of how we are designing and elevating sustainable brands is the launch of  target zero , an  initiative to help our guests more easily find hundreds of products across our assortment that create less packaging waste.  with respect to furthering diversity, equity and inclusion (de&i), target now offers a  debt-free  education assistance benefit to our more than   ,  full-time and part-time team members.  in march  , we completed the conversion of our vista, california, store to become target’s first  net zero energy store  – furthering our journey toward  net zero greenhouse gas emissions by  . these are just a few of the ways we are bringing solutions to life that better serve our communities and the environment. dozens of target forward initiatives are underway, and we are in the process of finalizing the roadmaps for others, an effort led by hand-selected teams of experts both within and outside of target. as we remain dedicated to learning through this process, we expect to find the pathway to our goals continuously evolving, based on new information and as we respond to those changing dynamics.  what role do external partners play  in the success of target forward?  target forward hinges on the input and participation  from hundreds of target vendors and suppliers, plus countless organizations we partner with in the communities we serve. to achieve aggressive goals, and to maximize the impact of our efforts at scale, target forward relies on a diverse set of stakeholders. it’s the only way to achieve meaningful social and environmental change.  by seeking differing viewpoints and engaging experts to address challenges and opportunities, target forward is poised to succeed in helping tackle such critical issues as racial equity, plastic waste and climate change.  this community-centric approach is especially important in achieving de&i within our enterprise, and within the community at large. guided by our  racial equity action and change (reach)  committee, we launched the target scholars  program  in partnership with united negro college  fund, which is providing  ,  first-year students at  historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) with $ ,  scholarships, as well as mentoring and internship opportunities. i’m pleased to report we are  further extending support for these students for the next three years, through graduation.  target forward isn’t just a part of our business. it is our business. and multifaceted partnerships are the linchpins to building a better future for generations to come.  amanda nusz  senior vice president of corporate responsibility & president of the target foundation    target esg report

and address a broad range of risks that could directly or indirectly impact our organization. overseen by our chief legal and risk officer, erm provides regular updates to senior leadership and our board of directors, and specifically the audit & risk committee. we assess climate, forests, water and other natural resource-related risks according to the impact on our business, team members and guests. each risk may impact factors such as sales, price stability, competitive advantage, stores, guests, communities and suppliers, and those impacts may vary in magnitude, duration or dependency. we also assess impact based on existing crisis preparedness or the ability to develop such contingency and resiliency plans.  climate adaptation  as we build out our net zero  goal roadmap, we  will continue to evaluate our climate-related risks and opportunities in line with the recommendations of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures (tcfd) (see our  tcfd index ). the  physical, financial and transitional risks and opportunities posed by climate change are factored into our management system, assessed for two time horizons ( –  years and  + years), and prioritized

engaged an independent third-party consultant to conduct an assessment in   aligned to the tcfd risks and opportunities taxonomy. as such, a number of transition risks and physical risks were included as part of our assessment. transition risks encompass what may occur as a result of a transition to a low-carbon economy, and physical risks include both acute and chronic risks, such as natural  disasters (acute) and longer-term impacts of a shift toward a warming climate (chronic). opportunities considered relate to target’s efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  we disclose the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities within our annual  cdp climate  response and leverage what we learn to advance  our climate mitigation and resilience strategies. we will also continue to develop our own reporting based on best practice guidance.  we continue to engage with policymakers to urge climate action, and work with ngos and trade associations such as the  retail

climate action  responsible resource use  we’re finding new ways to  manage water sustainably, putting the needs of people, communities and the planet at the heart of how we work to deliver on our target forward strategy.  water is essential to our agricultural materials for  food, textile products and manufacturing, and in the operation of every target facility. access to clean water is also a fundamental need for guests and communities all along our value chain, and we are committed to help build water resiliency in the areas where we operate so this need can always be met.  identifying and managing  water risks  when developing our management strategy, we  first identify water-related risks  that may have a  financial or strategic impact on our business and/ or communities where we operate. we focus on addressing high-priority areas, products and processes to safeguard freshwater quality, quantity and access. in the u.s., this is particularly important along the west coast — where water scarcity   is a significant issue — and  in the northeast where our greatest impacts relate to water quality. since  , we have been guided by our  freshwater stewardship approach .  annually, we use the wri’s aqueduct tool  to  understand water risk for both domestic and international facilities. one key finding from our latest assessment was that quantity and quality are issues we should continue to monitor and work to mitigate through increasingly robust measures.  in domestic locations, we are using the insights from this assessment to inform our latest water goals and to accelerate efforts in the highest-risk watersheds, identifying priority areas of impact based on withdrawals in water-stressed   areas.  this will help us focus efforts at facilities where there’s current and/or future potential for higher water risk.  in our manufacturing supply chain, this information is incorporated into a hotspot mapping exercise, alongside  higg fem  data. this helps us assess  their environmental footprint and prioritize which supply chain locations to focus on for programs like apparel impact institute (aii)’s clean by design. advancing target forward   through water security  securing water resources is a key consideration  across both our sustainable brands and waste elimination pillars. only by conserving water sources can we deliver sustainably sourced materials and operations that protect, sustain and restore nature.  we draw on key partnerships to direct efforts and reduce our impact, with a strategic focus on:  • food and fiber  in our raw material supply chain.  • textile and apparel factories in priority  watersheds in our manufacturing supply chain.  • water risk reduction and stormwater management in direct operations, supporting resilience and collective water security   in the  communities we serve.  in identifying water risks and water-stressed regions where we operate, we will begin to set new value chain goals that reflect the context of our water stewardship approach, as well as our understanding of setting targets around the nexus between climate, water and biodiversity. water use in our operations  while we work on developing new science-based contextual water goals in connection with target forward, we continue to operate under the principles originally outlined in our  freshwater  stewardship approach  to guide our ongoing work.  direct operations  across our stores, supply chain facilities and headquarters locations, we’re acting to reduce water scarcity and improve water quality outcomes.  target is recognized for maintaining best practices in managing stormwater and the quality of water leaving our sites. many of our facilities have stormwater management systems in place, and we partner with local organizations to improve infrastructure and benefit local watersheds.  we are also refining our salt application practices to reduce the amount of chloride entering local water bodies. target has many sites where salt is used to maintain safety during adverse weather conditions for guests and team members during the winter. to address any impacts the salt may have on local lakes and rivers, we refreshed our training at our stores, supply chain facilities and other sites that experience snow events. the training, which includes application techniques and disposal methods, is based on smart salting techniques developed by the  minnesota  pollution control agency . we will continue to evolve  our approach as new practices, techniques and equipment are developed.     water risk

identify properties that may have possible leaks or need plumbing repairs. at many locations where landscapes are irrigated, we use hydropoint smart controllers to water plants only when necessary, find underground leaks when they occur, and to pause irrigation when it’s raining or rainfall has been sufficient.  we are now exploring new goals that align with our stewardship approach. as we develop the next phase of our strategy, water stress and other water risks will be incorporated to determine priority projects and areas.  products  we are taking steps to reduce the impact of our product portfolio and production techniques on vulnerable water resources.  target is an associate member of the microfibre  consortium , which facilitates development of  practical solutions to

on fairness and equity   serving and strengthening communities  community-based philanthropy  we provide access to philanthropic support to  nonprofits across all communities where we have stores and supply chain facilities, and focus investment in key markets where the majority of our team members and guests live and work. for example, in california, we have partnered with the  united way of greater los angeles (uwgla)  to  support its cutting-edge, collaborative programs, impacting the lives of thousands of angelenos experiencing homelessness each year by building faster and more cost-effectively. through the affordable housing initiative (ahi), the uwgla aims to increase access to affordable rental units for those experiencing being at risk of homelessness. all of the properties developed will have a service partner to provide case management and stabilizing services such as mental health services, financial literacy, drug treatment, childcare or workforce training programs.  our local team members often know the needs of their own communities best; we work directly with our store and supply chain leaders to empower them with the resources and tools to make a local impact. through our community engagement funds and giftcard programs, store and supply chain leaders can directly support local initiatives, nonprofits and organizations that are addressing critical needs in their neighborhoods ranging from social justice to workforce development.  team member engagement  our local teams are empowered to drive community impact through volunteerism and pro bono efforts. our team members are committed to making our communities a better place and typically donate around one million hours of volunteer service every year, supporting the local causes they care about. even with the unique challenges to in-person volunteering posed by covid- , we were still able to contribute almost  ,  hours of in-person volunteering in  . team members served as election judges, participated in our pop-up food and essential giveaway events in response to civil unrest and took part in a variety of virtual opportunities.  our team members are generous with their time throughout the year, but they make a particular difference at key awareness events such as earth month, national volunteer week,  /  day of service, our annual giving campaign and martin luther king, jr. day of service.  to empower team members to use their skills and talents to address unmet needs in the community — and help with rebuilding efforts following the murder of george floyd — we launched a pro bono consulting service for bipoc-owned small businesses in the twin cities. in less than one year, we delivered more than  ,  hours of pro bono support, and in  , the program was extended to atlanta, chicago and the bay area. looking ahead, we plan to deliver at least  ,  hours of pro bono support every year.  finally, our headquarters-based legal team provides hundreds of hours of pro bono legal advice to individuals and organizations, offering guidance on housing law and immigration, and helping low-income individuals to start businesses. in  , at least half of our legal professionals participated in pro bono activities. cross-enterprise collaboration  going beyond philanthropy and team member engagement, our community vitality team works closely with other teams across the enterprise — from real estate and assets protection to government affairs — to support community impact.  target in action  engaging with  and listening to black communities  we’ve long been proactive when it comes to  engaging with black communities across the country, but in the wake of george floyd’s murder, the corporate responsibility and guest insights teams sought additional feedback to identify what more we could do. in partnership with store team members of color in markets including atlanta, chicago, los angeles, oakland and washington, d.c., we have:  • focused our work in predominantly black communities that have not just been acutely impacted by recent traumas but by decades, even centuries, of social injustice.  • listened to more than   individuals in one-on-one meetings and small groups, and via feedback from surveys. for example, when we open a new store, the team engages with local stakeholders to identify ways that we can support the neighborhood, such as local hiring events and celebrating what’s unique in the community.  • built trust with stakeholders critical to our business success in these markets, including guests, team members, government officials, small businesses and community organizations working to undo systemic racism and its impacts on black americans.  • identified the needs of these communities, from meeting basic needs to supporting the vitality of small businesses to supporting the pipeline of black team members.  • made investments and developed programs and partnerships based on our community engagement and understanding of what the community thinks target’s role at the local level should be.  by taking time to listen closely to these communities, we were able to identify trusted community partners to support philanthropically and drive team member engagement.    target esg report          introduction environmental social governance indexes and glossary community  social overview

colleagues and our guests, modeling a strong ethical culture through their everyday decisions and actions.  code of ethics  team members are required to follow applicable laws, target policies and our  code of ethics . they  are expected to report any actual or suspected violations, to which target will respond promptly and appropriately. the code of ethics outlines team members’ duty to also report any conflicts of interest immediately if they arise, and select team members must complete target’s conflicts of interest statement annually. our board members have a separate code of ethics, contained within our  corporate  governance guidelines , which is tailored to their  unique role. new members participate in an orientation program that covers different business aspects, including esg-related activities.  business partner code of conduct  because the actions of our suppliers and business partners reflect directly on target, we expect them to share our commitment to the fundamental principles of respect for human rights and environmental stewardship. our  business  partner code of conduct  (formerly vendor code  of conduct) communicates this expectation and, in  , we updated it to include equity and inclusion initiatives. suppliers must conduct their business with a high level of integrity and maintain transparent and accurate records. violations of the business partner code of conduct could result in an end to the business relationship with target.  ethics and compliance training  we provide team members with guidance on ethics and compliance responsibilities relevant to their roles. mandatory training is delivered during onboarding and then annually to reinforce these responsibilities.  we offer trainings covering key topics like anti-bribery, conflicts of interest, government interactions, anti-competitive behavior, environment, food safety and privacy. we also hold trainings on employment compliance, tailored to specific operations and team functions. anti-hate, anti-violence  and anti-racism  in recent years, we have witnessed a rise in  societal incidences of hate-based violence and racism against groups and communities, including women, people of particular faiths, people with disabilities and people in the bipoc and lgbtqia+ communities. we condemn all hate, racism and violence, and have introduced anti-racism experiences, immersions and trainings for all team members.  anti-bribery and corruption  we do not tolerate unethical or illegal business practices. our code of ethics and anti-bribery policy provide guidance that all team members must understand and follow. we strive to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws, including the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act, and require similar compliance from vendors, suppliers, contractors, subcontractors and their agents. team members who interact with government officials receive additional training to reinforce our anti-bribery policies and practices.  anti-competitive behavior  we believe that, by complying with competition and antitrust laws, we support free and fair competition between companies. our antitrust policy requires team members to comply with applicable laws and prohibits them from making agreements that restrain competition. transparency and reporting  to achieve transformative change, we believe target must carefully manage and measure our performance against tangible goals and publicly report on our progress. staying accountable for impacts and actions is how we maintain the trust of our suppliers, guests, team members, shareholders and partners. all target stakeholders are engaged and involved in our esg commitments and responsibilities.  we have been sharing our corporate

rights purchasing  practices  we are committed to  pursuing responsible purchasing practices that help us act as a fair business partner.  we have therefore set a goal to formally evaluate  the way we do business with those who manufacture our products.  through our partnership with better buying ,  a nonprofit organization focused on improving purchasing practices throughout the global supply chain, we annually assess the impact of our purchasing practices on supplier sustainability through a financial, environmental and social lens. we leverage this assessment to better understand how our day-to-day purchasing practices are affecting our suppliers, their workers and the environment.  in partnership with better buying, we rolled out a new educational training course to help commercial teams understand what purchasing practices are, why they are essential and how decisions can impact workers worldwide.  in the year ahead, we will continue to deepen our relationships with new and existing partners to achieve our ambitions. learn more about our focus areas for this work at  target.com/ targetforward . traceability and sustainability  in support of our target forward strategy,

protect people and uphold social responsibility standards throughout our global supply chain.  all our vendor relationships are guided by the  business partner code of conduct . this includes  our standards of vendor engagement (sove) ,  which outlines our expectations for vendors and serves as the anchor for embedding human rights throughout our supply chain, alongside our  labor  and human rights policies .  these core documents define the scope of our vendors’ ethical operations obligations.  additionally, applying target’s sove  is a  detailed guidebook on target’s expectations for supply chain human rights, as well as environmental standards we expect from suppliers, and has been made available to vendors in   different languages. we expect all our domestic and international business partners to respect human rights, and to comply with target’s sove and all applicable laws pertaining to human rights, including, without limitation, all laws applicable to workplace health, safety, labor and employment.  grievances  we are committed to providing target team members and workers in our supply chain with access to effective grievance mechanisms. we expect our business partners to share any concerns of potential misconduct so that we can investigate and address concerns promptly. in  , we partnered with human rights consultancy  article one  to create an in- depth training experience for our sourcing team members worldwide. this is intended to deepen their understanding of human rights issues and to recognize the importance of having effective grievance mechanisms in place for all workers in our supply chain.  our ethics and responsible sourcing and sustainability teams conduct ethics training with business partners in many parts of the world. the training promotes the  target integrity hotline ,  a channel available to all team members and supplier workers for confidentially reporting issues related to our sove; the call is free and handled by an independent third party, and local language interpreters are available. we do not share or publish specific grievances or specific issues raised and do not tolerate any retaliation against any team member who reports in good faith. our suppliers should also maintain effective grievance mechanisms for workers, aligned with the un guiding principles on business and human rights. during  , we distributed information on accessing and engaging with target’s integrity hotline to all factory and supplier locations. target continues to explore opportunities to increase accessibility to reporting options and drive comfort in using the reporting options provided.  in the event that a grievance is raised, target will thoroughly investigate all issues and manage them to closure through our sensitive case program.    target esg report                                                                                                 - -- --- - --introduction environmental social

vendors to use smelters and refiners that are certified as compliant with established conflict minerals standards.  target supports the humanitarian goals of the conflict minerals rules,   and annually conducts  a country of origin inquiry covering all product categories for owned brands or exclusive brands that we believe could contain tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold (collectively known as “ tg”). in  , the product categories we surveyed included:  • apparel and home textiles.  • electronics, lighting, kitchenware and small appliances.  • home improvement and automotive.  • footwear and luggage.  • accessories, jewelry and watches.  • furniture, home décor, bath and seasonal merchandise.  • lawn and garden.  • health and beauty products.  • toys, sporting goods and pet supplies.  • paper, office, stationery and scrapbooking. as outlined in our conflict minerals policy , target  will not knowingly purchase or sell any owned or exclusive brand product containing  tg that finances armed conflict in the democratic republic of congo (drc) and its adjoining regions. our vendors must adopt a  tg sourcing policy that is consistent with ours and with guidance from the  organisation for economic co-operation and  development (oecd) . we also require that vendors  report on the standard form developed by the  responsible minerals initiative (rmi) .  target maintains the right to audit suppliers on responsible  tg sourcing. in  , we surveyed   vendors of owned and exclusive brand products in categories that might contain  tg, receiving responses from  % of them. we encourage vendors to identify and source from smelters and refiners certified by the rmi as “conformant.”   of the   smelters and refiners identified by surveyed vendors that provided product-level information met this status.  target could only determine the smelters and refiners that processed a portion of the  tg contained in its potentially in-scope products. as such, while none of the necessary  tg within in-scope products was determined to directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the drc and its adjoining countries, we have not determined that any of our potentially in-scope products are “drc conflict free.” audits and continuous  improvement  because we believe in making a collective impact,  we value common or shared audit programs, addressing issues that are too big for any one company to tackle alone through collaboration with others.  our responsible sourcing and sustainability audit program covers all facilities   that manufacture or  convert raw materials into:  • target owned brand products and packaging.  • target exclusive products and packaging.  • target-distributed products and/or nationally branded products and packaging for which target is the importer of record.  our risk-based audit program assesses facility conditions, worker treatment and compensation, hiring processes, environmental practices and compliance with applicable laws and target’s sove. all disclosed manufacturing locations must conduct regular audits and have them approved by our industry-aligned audit protocol. in   and  , the coronavirus pandemic, travel and factory restrictions, and office closures related to covid-  decreased the ability for onsite audits to be conducted in many regions globally.  reflective of the changing industry landscape, target is further evolving its oversight approach to go beyond compliance, including implementing an industry-converged approach to assessment, and introducing more direct worker reporting channels and other real-time insights to understand emerging business and human rights risk. target has also increased our disclosure requirements further back in the supply chain, including requirements about facility disclosure. target maintains the right to conduct unannounced audits of any disclosed locations.  in  , our team delivered   training programs on this industry-converged approach to  ,  internal team members and suppliers — more than  ,  training hours in total. the feedback we received from suppliers is that, by accepting several audit programs, suppliers’ facilities are more proactive in identifying root causes of issues and making improvements that benefit workers.  learn more about our auditing process and  programs  on our website.  we prioritize remediation and continuous improvement but, in some cases, noncompliant audits may result in the cancellation of purchase orders and the termination of business relationships. target will not allow a vendor to use a previously noncompliant factory until the deactivation period has expired and the factory has demonstrated compliance with target’s sove and applicable laws.  in  , we rolled out our first human rights training to key business areas, including merchandising, owned brands, sourcing and corporate responsibility. the training covered an overview of business and human rights and target’s

necessities. i even bought my first toy in the u.s. there. years later, i came to target to work as an art director, and creating a permanent mural for the exterior of this particular store is a full-circle moment for me.  my mural is inspired by the word “together” in shelby’s poem, and a lot of the visual representation is connected to my personal work and heritage as a mexican. the butterflies represent all the immigrant communities that grew and established along the lake street corridor. the biggest inspiration for the middle piece was seeing how neighbors showed up for each other after the minneapolis protests.  there’s so much value in showing up for others, especially in these hard times. and this community is filled with so much resilience. over the years, i’ve seen
