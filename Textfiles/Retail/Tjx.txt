report delivering  real value at tjx, our corporate responsibility  efforts are anchored by our company’s  mission to deliver great value to our  customers every day. for   years that  mission has remained steadfast, and so  has our commitment to acting as a respon- sible corporate citizen. we believe this is as  important as ever and we focus our efforts  under four key pillars:  /our workplace   /environmental sustainability  /our communities   /responsible business many of our corporate responsibility reporting  initiatives take into consideration various global  standards and reporting frameworks. for example,  we have reviewed and incorporated a number of  relevant human rights standards enunciated by  international organizations, such as the united  nations and the international labour organization,  into our global social compliance program. we also  map our global corporate responsibility report to  certain frameworks, including the global reporting  initiative (gri) standards, the international sustain- ability standards board’s sasb standards, and the  united nations sustainable development goals  (unsdgs). in addition, we have responded to the  cdp climate change questionnaire since  . our global corporate responsibility executive  steering committee reviews and considers our               corporate responsibility efforts from a cross-functional and cross-divisional perspective. in doing so, the  committee, among other things, guides corporate  responsibility strategies to align them with tjx  business priorities, supports our global corporate  responsibility efforts across functions and geogra- phies, facilitates corporate responsibility information  exchange, recommends additional program efforts,  and, through the committee’s executive sponsor,  periodically reports on our progress to the compa- ny’s senior management and board of directors. the  committee is led by a senior executive vice president  (sevp), group president, who, among his other      duties, provides management oversight of tjx’s envi- ronmental, social, and governance (esg) initiatives. we think of our global corporate responsibility  program as ever evolving, and we are pleased to  present our continued progress here. corporate  responsibility has been part of the fabric of who we  are from day one, and we strive to make a mean- ingful impact on the world, with our efforts reflecting  our core values of honesty, integrity, and treating  each other with dignity and respect. “it is clear to us that our commit- ment to continuing to develop and  implement meaningful environ- mental, social, and governance  (esg) practices is as important as  ever. it’s what we believe our cus- tomers, communities, and other  stakeholders expect of us––and  it’s what we demand of ourselves.”  ernie herrman chief executive officer and president /       /      a   global corporate responsibility report our workplace % of

broad range of our  stakeholders’ priorities. today’s challenges are many—our world is still struggling with a global  pandemic, social injustice, war, the threat of climate change, and so  much more. it is clear to us that our commitment to continuing to  develop and implement meaningful environmental, social, and gov- ernance (esg) practices is as important as ever. it’s what we believe our  customers, communities, and other stakeholders expect of us—and it’s  what we demand of ourselves.  i am so proud of our ever-evolving global corporate responsibility programming, which has been part of the fabric of  who we are for   years. our reporting is organized around the pillars where we believe we can make a significant  difference for our stakeholders – workplace, communities, environmental sustainability, and responsible business.  our work in these areas helps us contribute towards the ongoing development, implementation, and evolution of  meaningful initiatives and practices across our operations designed to be inclusive and more sustainable and that  demonstrate our commitments and progress to operate our off-price business responsibly. for example, in april  , we announced plans to expand and accelerate our goals as part of our ongoing  environmental sustainability strategy. the new goals focus on climate and energy, waste, and product packaging,  including a plan to achieve net zero emissions in our global operations by  . additionally, we are committed to continuing to build a more inclusive and diverse workplace where our associates  feel welcome, valued, and engaged. in fiscal  , we completed a global inclusion and diversity survey of our  associates and used the findings to help define three core areas of focus for our work moving forward: increase  the representation of diverse associates along our talent pipeline; equip leaders with the tools to support difference  with awareness, fairness, sensitivity, and transparency; and empower all associates to integrate inclusive behaviors,  language, and practices in how we work together and understand our role and responsibility in inclusion. as we work toward making ongoing progress, we expect corporate responsibility will continue to be a valuable  part of how we do business. we look forward to continuing to report on our efforts and progress in our annual  global corporate responsibility report, in addition to the rolling updates on our efforts that we share on tjx.com.  as always, i want t thank our global associates for their efforts, hard work, and dedication to tjx.

business priorities year in and year out. we believe this encourages  many associates to join us not just to find a job, but to build a career. inclusion and diversity have long been a  priority at tjx, and we are continuing our  work to do more. the diversity of our associates makes us a stronger company and better able to serve our broad and diverse  base of customers around the world. we strive for an inclusive workplace where our associates feel welcome  when they walk in the door; valued for their diversity of thought, background, and experience; and engaged with  our mission to

identities, abilities, experiences, religions, and much  more, who come together to move our business forward. as a business, we do not tolerate discrimination or hate  of any kind. we believe every

trainings to support our recruiting efforts. in fiscal  , leaders across our  recruitment teams participated in unconscious bias training to help us continue creating an inclusive  recruitment process. additionally, we have implemented a new tool in the u.s., canada, and europe in an  effort to reduce potential unconscious biases in job descriptions and other recruitment communications  and to identify language that may inadvertently undermine our inclusion efforts. we also benchmark  periodically against peers to better understand how we can leverage opportunities to expand awareness  of tjx and our available jobs among diverse audiences. we are actively pursuing opportunities to increase minority candidate representation when we recruit for  early career positions. in the u.s., we have enhanced our outreach to historically black colleges and  universities (hbcus) and partner with diverse on-campus organizations for recruitment events. we have  developed and expanded relationships with several non-profit partners focused on increasing opportunities  for underrepresented students, such as leadership enterprise for a diverse america (leda), the posse  foundation, and girls who code. in europe, we recruit from a diverse pool of candidates for our graduate,  placement, and apprenticeship programmes and partner with organizations such as the prince’s trust,  the uk government’s department for work and pensions, and the uwv in the netherlands to create  career opportunities for disadvantaged young people, including many from underrepresented communities.  globally, we continue to broaden our relationships with schools, universities, and smaller colleges to widen  our reach. we are also committed to working toward increasing the representation of diverse candidates in  management-level positions, including people of color, lgbtq+ individuals, people with disabilities, and  women. in certain u.s. markets, we are also considering ways to better

talent to support our efforts to improve the diversity at all levels of our  organization. consistent with our inclusion and diversity efforts, in march  , our board approved a policy that, in the  event that our board commences a search for a chief executive officer from outside tjx, or if our manage- ment commences a search for an executive-level role reporting directly to the ceo from outside tjx, the  initial list of candidates will include qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates. if our board or  our management engages a third-party firm for such a search, that firm will be instructed to include qualified  female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates in the initial list of candidates provided to tjx. on-campus recruiting: from their campus to ours historically, several hundred students each year have taken part in tjx internship and co-op programs  operating across our divisions worldwide, in areas including merchandising, finance, human resources,  information technology, store operations, distribution services, and more. we seek candidates who are  curious and have a passion for innovation, relationship building, strategic thinking, and global relations. our merchandising internships and co-ops are coveted among many students, especially those who have  a passion for various aspects of the retail industry. globally, many participants in these programs join us  full-time after completing their college requirements. proudly hiring those who have served in the u.s. military our long-standing commitment to the u.s. armed forces is highlighted by our dedication to hiring veterans  and military service members, including active guard and reserve, as well as their spouses. we value their  strong work ethic, professionalism, and loyalty and offer a range of career options to match their talents and  expertise. tjx has several initiatives supporting military hiring, including participating in career fairs for military personnel  and working with military job boards to increase exposure and marketing efforts to military personnel and  their families. the company also keeps in touch with current and prospective candidates through our military  talent community page and email campaigns. we are pleased to report that we have hired more than  ,  associates who are members of the military,  veterans,

employment and training opportunities  to individuals with varying levels of skills and abilities, including those who face barriers to employment or  are in underserved communities. we have developed community outreach strategies to help us foster a  diverse workforce that includes qualified individuals with a breadth of abilities. teams in the u.s. and europe participate in innovative youth programs which offer personal and  professional development opportunities for disadvantaged or vulnerable young people. in fiscal  , tjx  in the u.s. launched a program called community referred associates, which is dedicated to creating  training and employment opportunities for individuals that may have had difficulty with obtaining longer-term  employment opportunities in the past. as part of the program, tjx has partnered with several community-  based organizations to offer temporary,  -day roles focused on job training and aims to transition eligible  participants to a part- or full-time associate. tjx also continues partnering with junior achievement in the  u.s and supports the organization in providing work readiness, entrepreneurship, and financial literacy  skills for young people. through this connection, tjx associates have the opportunity to volunteer in local  junior achievement programs. tjx europe has a long-standing commitment to help vulnerable children and young people achieve their  potential in local communities. in fiscal  , tjx europe launched a partnership with the u.k. government’s  kickstart scheme to support young people aged  -  through six-month work placements and training  at t.k. maxx and homesense stores across england, wales, and scotland. more than   young people  have enrolled in this program since it began in september  , committing to   hours of work experience  and on-the-job skills training per week, coupled with employability training and resources provided in partnership  with the prince’s trust. with a combination of work experience and trainings, the program aims to help young  people secure sustained employment when their kickstart placement ends. to support its field recruitment efforts, our canadian team partners with various organizations through our  find your stride charitable initiative, which aims to help women get the skills and support they need to  move forward. through our partnership with the calgary women in need society, we support the tjx  retail ready program—an eight-week program that provides in-class training, on-the-floor retail experience,  and mock interview support to help prepare women for careers in retail. in the u.s., tjx partners with best buddies international, a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating  opportunities for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. our teams partner closely with  best buddies volunteers and participants to find roles in our t.j. maxx, marshalls, homegoods, sierra,  and homesense

i was becoming more reliant  on my husband to be my only source of a social  life, which was nice of course for a time! however,  it isn’t practical in the long run. i had no sense of  routine or activity, and this played a huge role in  diminishing my mental health. “i had an incredible, life-changing experience on  this programme with the prince’s trust. it really  promoted my physical health and mental well-being, i met some incredible people working in t.k. maxx  which has helped to increase my social life and i have made a best friend for life from this course! since  taking part in the virtual online workshops, i have noticed within myself: increased confidence, public  speaking, and time management. in my personal life i feel that i have gained my independence here in  manchester for the first time. i have been using public transport to get to work but also i was able to get a  train to visit my family for eid celebrations, something i have not been able to do up until now, without the  help of my husband. “i have become so much more confident; i used to be so hesitant to go out. i now have the confidence in  my experiences on programme to put myself out there for other opportunities!” — wardah, get into retail participant with t.k. maxx & homesense, manchester    global corporate responsibility report /       /       career development attracting talent is just the start. at tjx,  we believe our associates are core  to our success and, as such, it is our        responsibility to train and mentor them.  our senior leaders consider teaching  and mentoring an absolute priority to  support the career development of our  associates. training happens throughout the organization  and in a variety of settings, including in our  stores, distribution and processing centers, and  corporate offices. some is formal, through courses offered in our classrooms and virtually, and some is informal,  such as in huddles or through real-time feedback on the job. like so many aspects of our work, training had to  be reimagined with the onset of the covid-  pandemic. it has been important to us to maintain our commit - ment to talent development while navigating changes to our work environments. as a result, we have been  approaching our learning opportunities differently, offering many formal training classes online and connecting  remote associates through virtual formats. no matter the location or format, formal or informal, our career  development initiatives are designed to foster open communication and relationship building, which are both  key parts of our culture. development programs our leadership development toolkit has defined leadership competencies and  cultural factors which help express our organizational values and promote  consistency in leadership development. in fiscal  , we included new leadership  competency and cultural factors focused on inclusion-based values and  behaviors, which we are working to incorporate into our toolkit over the coming  year. we strongly believe that these competencies and factors benefit our  business overall. one of our goals is to foster career growth across the organization, and we  are proud that in fiscal  ,  % of managerial  positions in our stores and  field offices were filled with internal promotions. additionally, we believe that our  development programs support associates in building a career at tjx, and, in  fact,  % of people in managerial  positions around the world have been at the  company for   or more years. our global leadership curriculum is designed to offer a consistent development experience focused  around our leadership competencies and cultural factors. with core and elective courses, this curriculum  helps associates gain skills in communications, achieving results, interpersonal dynamics, and more. we  are currently reviewing and updating the courses to further align our leadership courses with our inclusion  , + attendance in  global leadership  curriculum courses  since   g   global corporate responsibility report /       /       and diversity efforts. since  , the global leadership curriculum has had associate attendance of more  than  ,  across all of our divisions. our aim is to develop the potential of associates at every level, from  hourly associates to management and beyond, so they may enjoy fulfilling careers. this year, additional  programs were added to provide development for higher levels of leadership that focused on successfully  transitioning and taking on new and expanded leadership responsibilities. to further extend the availability of  learning opportunities, we also made available a global online learning library of over  ,  digital, self- paced learning resources. in addition to our global leadership curriculum courses, we offer many other learning and development  opportunities. our global emerging leaders program is designed to help high potential associates at the  managerial level prepare to expand their leadership roles. the process consists of targeted assessments,  review of feedback, and the creation of an individual development plan. once completed, these associates  have the opportunity to participate in the emerging leader action learning, a seven month-long journey  focusing on the skills needed to effectively grow from a leader of others to a leader of leaders. participants  are placed on cross-functional teams, assigned self-directed learning, participate in peer coaching, and  spend time with executives, who share their stories and experiences. the program consists of critical skills  training and business case scenarios, and it culminates in the associate creating a personalized growth  plan. we are also proud to have launched a mentorship pilot in fiscal  , which aims to connect associates  with leaders in our organization and to subsequently foster their development. more senior-level associates may participate in our global strategic leadership program—an  -month,  global development program designed to accelerate leadership readiness. the program offers a variety of  opportunities, including gaining exposure to different leaders, tjx businesses, and business units. participants  receive feedback on their leadership style and interactions throughout the process, with the goal of incorporating  those learnings into their leadership style. participants learn to navigate the organization, build strategic  planning skills, and deepen their understanding of the business and of themselves as leaders. in canada, our goal is to equip, empower, and enable our associates to own their development in partnership  with their manager. we host a national learning calendar that provides virtual workshops focusing on  professional and leadership development, a vast set of online learning offerings, and a digital library. in our  home office and distribution centers, a “one-stop shop” website provides support for building development  plans, learning about our off-price business model, and enhancing personal growth through curated learning  and augmented by storytelling from our associates and leaders. we are excited to bring our “be your best  self” developmental focus to stores this year with a focus on inspirational associate videos, promotion  highlights, and leadership messaging that supports our tuition assistance, scholarship, and other career  development programs. tjx canada also offers targeted training for many new and existing associates to support their deepening  business and leadership capabilities. these programs include manager in training (mit) in our stores and  district offices and tiered onboarding programs in distribution services. our focus on “accessible development  for all” means providing the tools and support associates need to drive their career. “be your best self” is also our learning philosophy in europe. tjx europe aims to enable our associates to  own and drive their development journey, recognizing that this is as unique as each and every one of us.  we offer associates a range of learning and development options to provide skills and off-price knowledge  through workshops, development programs, training, on-the-job learning, and the graduate, placement,  and apprenticeship programmes. we also offer tools for self-learning and provide bespoke coaching for  regional, country, district, store, and assistant managers.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       in addition, tjx europe’s leader in me program is designed to accelerate the leadership readiness of  managers who show potential for more senior roles. associates learn more about themselves as leaders,  as well as how to use these leadership skills in their current roles and for future opportunities. we also  have a senior leadership development program in europe for vice presidents and assistant vice presidents,  which cultivates leaders who champion and bring our distinctive culture to life. the program develops  skills to help leaders thrive in unpredictable circumstances. participants gain insight into themselves as  authentic leaders and gain self-awareness, personal sustainability, and leadership perspective. we recently  expanded this program to include specific workshops on inclusion and diversity. we believe the program  builds stronger, more collaborative teams across the organization and elevates the capability of our senior  leaders. in australia, corporate and processing center associates can participate in the be your best self program,  a self-led curriculum that enables associates to drive their own development. through various tools and  manager support, participants are able to discover new skills and interests to assist them in developing a  career path, whether that means growing in their current role, or exploring opportunities cross-functionally. merchant training and tjx university we are particularly proud of our merchant training programs around the world, which we believe are some  of the best and most respected in the retail industry. our programs are designed to support associates  interested in pursuing careers as merchants and develop them as future leaders in our off-price retail business.  the merchandising career path provides structured growth potential in merchandise planning and allocation  and merchandise buying, as well as potential management opportunities. the path consists of an initial,  intensive training curriculum for a role as an allocation analyst. afterwards, there are ongoing development  opportunities and mentoring throughout the associate’s career. we are also proud to run tjx university, where we offer merchandising associates learning opportunities  through a two-year-long, one-on-one coaching program. the program includes mentoring on negotiation  skills, store exercises, and a curated curriculum to both further their development in their current role and  prepare them for the next step in their careers. the coaching may take place in-person or virtually in a group  learning environment, in our stores, or in the marketplace. the university has a global reach to our merchants  around the world. our focus is to teach a consistent approach to our off-price business model, negotiating  fundamentals, and building strong relationships—all of which have been a critical part of our success. for some of the buyers and merchandising managers identified as having potential to rise to a leadership  level, we offer a specialized learning experience called the off-price leadership center (oplc). it brings  together associates from across our global divisions to get exposure to the critical merchant and leadership  skills necessary for success. oplc’s focus is on understanding the role; integrating strategic, business,  and critical relationship skills; and building a diverse, global leadership perspective. external partnerships in addition to our many internal development opportunities, we have established relationships with a variety of  organizations to offer additional resources and learning. in the u.s., this includes national hispanic  corporate council, catalyst, diversity best practices, pflag, national association of asian american professionals, human rights campaign, and others. our associates also have the opportunity to  participate in programs offered by some of our partner organizations. we belong to conexión in boston,    global corporate responsibility report /       /       massachusetts, and, on a u.s. national level, the partnership. conexión pairs hispanic/latino associates  with a seasoned mentor at organizations in various industries and provides workshops in leadership. the  partnership offers year-long programs in leadership and cultural navigation for associates, as well  as the next generation executive program, a five-month training course. we actively bring together  associate alumni of both programs to build a network that can support participants and encourage  learning. in  , a number of associates had the opportunity to participate in an external leadership  program designed for black executives and early-mid-career managers. additionally, in  , tjx europe  became members of the business disability forum to support our efforts to help those who face barriers to  employment thrive at work. chantae’s story chantae joined tjx in   as a general warehouse associate for  our marmaxx division—first as a temporary hire and promoted to a  full-time associate shortly thereafter. during her time, she demon- strated potential and an eagerness to learn and grow, taking on  multiple roles and finding mentors who believed in her and pushed  her to seek out growth opportunities. as she developed her career,  chantae ultimately made her way to the human resources division,  where she currently serves as learning and development manager  and leads a team of five across three distribution centers. “i came in the door looking for a job and i found a career. so many  people have encouraged me along the way, pushing me to act on  my potential. being part of learning and development has been life  changing—not only for my professional growth but also personally.  i have stepped completely out of my comfort zone, met and built  relationships with lots of great people, and found it really rewarding  to support others’ growth. there is so much talent

view diversity as  inclusive of many facets—race,  ethnicity, age, sexual orientation,  gender identity, ability, experience,  religion, perspectives, and much  more—and we know that a diverse  workforce can help us to think  creatively, remain agile, and,  importantly, be true to our values. we are strongly committed to continuing to  build a more inclusive and diverse workplace  where all our associates feel welcome in  the company, valued for their perspectives  and contributions, and engaged with our  business mission to deliver great value to  our customers every day. we strive to treat  all people with dignity and respect and do  not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or  hate of any kind. these expectations are  reinforced to all associates in our tjx global  code of conduct. we appreciate that this work is a journey. as an important part of that journey, in fiscal   we completed a  global inclusion and diversity survey of our associates and used the findings to help define three core areas of  focus for our inclusion and diversity work:  /increase the representation of diverse associates along our talent pipeline.

http://web.jhu.edu/dlc/resources/diversity_wheel/h   global corporate responsibility report /       /       areas of focus while inclusion and diversity have consistently played an important part in who we are as a company, we  are aware that our work in this area is evolving and can be more effective with input from our associates.  we provide opportunities for our associates around the world to share their feedback, thoughts, and  personal experiences with inclusion and diversity at tjx. as such, we have taken time over the past two  years to listen to our associates and re-assess our company-wide inclusion and diversity efforts. over the course of fiscal   and  , we invited our global associates—who numbered more than   ,  at the time, across all facets and functions of our business—to participate in a global inclusion  and diversity survey. while we found the overall results to be encouraging, the data we gathered has  helped us define our global strategy to further support a more inclusive and diverse workplace. to underpin our work in this area, we have expanded our leadership competencies and cultural factors,  which help express our organizational values and promote consistency in leadership development, to in- clude a new leadership competency and cultural factor focused on inclusion-based values and behaviors. by  formally establishing inclusion and diversity as a core organizational principle, we continue to integrate  inclusion into the fabric of who we are as a company. additionally, to continue to hear from our associates, this past year we launched inclusion and diversity  advisory boards in the u.s., europe, and canada. the advisory boards include associates representing  a variety of functions, levels, and backgrounds across our stores, distribution and processing centers, and  corporate offices. advisory board members are expected to provide recommendations and feedback to  support our continuing inclusion and diversity work and guide us in striving to align our programming with  the needs of various associate populations. taken together, these actions are designed to further embed inclusion and diversity within our culture and  business practices. they have helped inform our near-, medium-, and long-term global inclusion and di- versity strategies, plans, and initiatives—including many of the activities we are proud to report on below.  we recognize that as a global company, regional differences may require different approaches; therefore,  as we enhance our global program, we are also empowering our regions across the globe to adjust their  initiatives to meet local needs. areas of focus: increase the representation of diverse associates along our talent pipeline we recognize that having a diverse associate base can help make us a stronger company and  better able to serve our broad base of customers around the world. as we aim to increase the areas of  focuschampioning inclusionour diverse  workforcepay equity    global corporate responsibility report /       /       representation of diverse associates along our talent pipeline, we are working to increase our  efforts to recruit more diverse talent while continuing to focus on providing diverse associates  greater access to development opportunities. to support our recruiting strategies, we continue to build on the training we offer to our talent acquisition  teams, including through educational opportunities focused on inclusion and diversity. we use a tool in  the u.s., canada, and europe designed to help identify and reduce potential unconscious biases  in job descriptions and other recruiting materials. our talent acquisition department has also estab - lished an inclusion and diversity committee that aims to increase proactive outreach to diverse com- munities, engagement with diverse candidates, and awareness and education with internal decision- makers involved in hiring processes. we are actively pursuing opportunities to increase minority candidate representation in early career  positions, and we continue to work to expand the ways we approach our search for early career  professionals. to inspire a broader range of candidates to consider careers at tjx, in fiscal  , we  developed and expanded relationships with several nonprofit partners in the u.s.—such as leadership  enterprise for a diverse america, the posse foundation, bottom line, and thrive scholars—and have  worked with them to support events, career development, and recruitment opportunities for under - represented high school and college students. we have also enhanced our outreach to historically  black colleges and universities (hbcus) and partnerships with diverse on-campus organizations  for recruitment events. we believe these connections can help us create a pipeline of future diverse  talent with tjx. associates at tjx have the opportunity to access an array of development and retention opportunities  internally and through external partnerships. tjx’s global leadership curriculum and our emerging  leaders program are among our strong internal professional development resources. we also have  partnered with community-based non-profit organizations—such as the partnership, conexión, and  a third-party leadership academy designed for black executives and early- to mid-career managers in  the u.s. and europe, and through business in the community in europe—to create access to external  professional development programs for our diverse associates. we are proud of our culture that  prioritizes development and advancement within our organization, as we simultaneously work to  build a more diverse pipeline of talent to support our efforts to increase diversity at all levels of our  organization. equip leaders with the tools to support difference with  awareness, fairness, sensitivity, and transparency to support our efforts to fully integrate inclusion into our culture and business practices, we recognize  that it is important that leaders from the very top and through every level of our organization exemplify  and model a culture of inclusion. we have made it a priority to equip our leaders with the training and  tools needed to better understand and embrace working with those who are different than themselves.  by adding a focus on inclusion to our leadership competencies and cultural factors, we aim to  formalize inclusion as a foundational value that represents who we are as a company and how we  expect our leaders and associates to show up every day. as part of this, we are developing tools to  support leaders across the company in reflecting on and implementing inclusion-based values and  behaviors. in tandem with this process, we are updating our leadership development toolkit to help  leaders across the company deepen their understanding and implementation of inclusion-based  values and behaviors. we are also enhancing our global leadership curriculum to provide our newly    global corporate responsibility report /       /       hired and recently promoted leaders with tools to champion inclusion and encourage, empower, and  engage their direct reports. in addition to providing tools to support their own learning, we are also equipping managers with  resources to help them engage in dialogue with their teams, including support for managers in our  stores and distribution centers, to lead discussions with associates around inclusion, diversity, and  other challenging topics, such as unconscious bias. empower all associates to integrate inclusive behaviors, language, and  practices in how we work together and understand our role and  responsibility in inclusion inclusion is an ongoing journey, and everyone can play a part. for many years, tjx has offered  education to increase associates’ inclusion and diversity awareness. we believe this helps our  associates better understand how to foster a stronger culture of inclusion in the workplace, and  we expect to continue to focus on these foundational education and awareness-building initiatives.  when onboarding new hires, our orientation materials emphasize the high value we place on  inclusion and diversity, and current associates have access to an array of online learning resources.  in fiscal  , we enhanced our education efforts to include an inclusion and diversity awareness  training program, which was completed by thousands of tjx leaders globally, as well as a “standing  for racial justice” webinar series for associates in our u.s. home office. some of our other activities in  this area include rolling out an updated unconscious bias training globally, new inclusion and diversity  trainings and materials in europe, and a speaker series on inclusion and diversity in canada, among  many additional initiatives. to promote awareness and align with best practices, we are also working to continue to encourage  honest conversations and associate feedback. over the past two years, our inclusion and diversity  teams in the u.s., europe, and canada have conducted associate listening sessions and focus  groups to help guide open conversations, solicit input, and grow our collective capacity to be  champions of inclusion. in fiscal  , we launched inclusion & diversity advisory boards in the  u.s., europe, and canada, which are intended to empower cross-functional groups of associates  from our stores, distribution and processing centers, and offices to advise on our current and future  inclusion and diversity work. across various functions within the organization, associates are setting  up committees to better incorporate inclusion and diversity into our everyday work—including in  merchandising, where teams are finding opportunities to use an inclusion and diversity lens on product  assortments as appropriate for our opportunistic buying and off-price business model. this past year we also launched a new global mentorship pilot initiative to foster associates’ devel- opment by connecting them with leaders in our organization. the pilot is focused on associates in  our associate resource groups and includes formal mentoring relationships, informal mentoring,  and facilitated mentoring roundtables that are designed to generate group conversations on topics  that were identified during focus group sessions, including career guidance, executive presence,  self-awareness, and authentic leadership. additionally, in fiscal  , we also launched our new being inclusive framework to support all  associates, including managers and other leaders, in becoming more self-aware, committing to  supporting others, and championing inclusivity. in the u.s., we are bringing this framework to life  through our being inclusive every day initiative that helps leaders facilitate conversations in our  offices, stores, and distribution centers.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       championing inclusion being an inclusive organization—and making associates feel welcome, valued, and engaged at tjx—is  important to us as a company, and we continue in our efforts to model and integrate inclusive behaviors,  languages, and practices through our organization. one of the ways we do this is through our associate  resource groups (args), which we have been proud to champion in the u.s. for many years and are  excited to begin expanding to other regions. tjx’s args are informal yet well organized, and they typically  develop annual business plans that outline their goals and objectives. many args also manage their own  annual operating budgets and have funds available for charitable giving and/or community programs. our  arg groups often host a wide range of events each year, including educational programming for group mem- bers and for the general associate population, volunteer opportunities, social events, and fundraising initiatives. in the u.s., we have   active args that support associate networking, development, and connection.  in fiscal  , tjx launched its newest u.s. arg, the black leadership & associate coalition (blac), to  help foster workplace belonging and build a stronger community for our black associates. other args  in the u.s. aim to support associates with disabilities, members of the lgbtq+ community, multicultural  associates, women, working parents, and members of the u.s. armed forces. we are proud to be expanding our arg program globally. in fiscal  , we piloted our first args in  europe and plan to continue rolling out additional groups in the near future. in europe, our args include  groups dedicated to supporting asian, black, female, disabled, and lgbtq+ communities, in addition to  a group dedicated to wellbeing. europe’s pilot args include associates in corporate offices, processing  centers, and stores and are currently focused on developing their individual priorities, which will help tjx  europe continue to evolve its inclusion and diversity efforts moving forward as consistent with tjx’s global  core areas of focus. in canada, we have set up inclusion and diversity committees for home office asso- ciates, distribution center associates, and store and regional office associates. like args, these commit- tees aim to provide opportunities for associates to share input, generate ideas, and develop annual plans  regarding various inclusion- and diversity-related areas. as in europe, tjx canada’s committees will also  help inform the region’s strategic inclusion and diversity initiatives in support of tjx’s global core areas of focus. tjx is committed to doing our part to continue to support our many types of diverse associates as well  as to foster greater inclusion within our communities. beyond args, in the u.s., we enhanced our paren - tal leave policy for benefits-eligible associates to be more supportive of working parents, and we proudly  offer transgender-inclusive healthcare, services, and transition support for benefits-eligible associates.  we also fly the flags of the countries represented by our associates at our distribution centers; have  a gender-neutral dress code policy; and, when not impacted by covid-  restrictions, typically have a  large presence in annual pride parades. we continue to stand by our   commitment to stand up for  our black associates, customers, and communities, and as we see examples of violence and discrimination,  including against the asian and pacific islander communities and other underrepresented groups, we are  reminded that we need to continue to work toward a better future for all people.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       our

emissions: in our direct operations energy efficiency operations teams in each of our geographies are actively working to manage our energy consumption and  costs, analyze and improve our operational performance, and test potential technologies in the facilities we  operate to help us drive progress against our operational goals. specifically, our tactics include:   / implementing light-emitting diode (led) technologies  /retrofitting lighting and hvac systems in existing stores and distribution centers in certain geographies  /exploring and leveraging utility level incentives and programs we are also exploring new technologies to optimize access and use of our energy data as well as evalu- ating battery energy storage and demand-control ventilation for hvac, which may be applicable across  certain facility types. renewable and low-carbon energy we source low-carbon and renewable energy to further reduce our ghg emissions from electricity con- sumption. some examples of our current sourcing strategies include:  / wholesale power purchase agreements  /on-site power purchase agreements  /electricity supply contracts  / renewable energy credits on-site solar in the u.s., distribution centers in arizona, connecticut, and nevada and select stores in new jersey,  connecticut, new york, massachusetts, and california have installed solar panels, resulting in an estimat- ed $ ,  savings each year. these projects are on buildings we own or where market conditions and  landlord partnerships enable projects.  offsetting in certain geographies, we leverage carbon offsets  to offset emissions resulting from our direct operations  and business travel.  for example, tjx canada has been carbon neutral for its scope   and   and reported scope   (business  travel and waste) emissions from operations for its fourth consecutive year. the team reduced energy  usage and purchased renewable energy credits as well as carbon offsets to support this strategy. in fiscal   , from a combination of projects focused on forest conservation and small-scale hydro-electric gener - ation in countries where we actively source merchandise, tjx canada offset emissions associated with its  operations, business travel, and waste, totaling  ,  metric tons co e. transportation and fuel although tjx does not generally own or lease the vehicles that transport our merchandise, we do include  some emissions in our operational footprint (scope  ) from limited sources, including those where we  directly manage our logistics and distribution, such as in the u.k. and ireland outbound store deliveries  as well as fleet vehicles. together with our partners, we work to increase fuel efficiency and reduce costs,  with the goal of decreasing the impact of our vehicles on the environment. our key strategies for reducing  these emissions include:   global corporate responsibility report /       /       in the u.s. we:   / utilize hybrid cars for a small portion of our fleet vehicles. in the u.k. and ireland, we:  / incorporate a “sustainability” clause in our new logistics agreements, which covers both trucking and store  delivery vehicles and commits both parties to achieving key environmental goals aligned with tjx targets.  / have increased the use of both our longer-semi trailers and our liquified natural gas (lng) tractor  units, resulting in carbon emissions reductions of approximately   metric tons per year.  / support ongoing initiatives including the implementation of fleet analytics and tire pressure monitoring  to deliver incremental fuel efficiency.  /regularly review our delivery schedules to reduce miles traveled, implementing measures such as  reducing empty running, combining store deliveries, and maximizing vehicle sizes. building green we have constructed new buildings and  incorporated environmentally sustainable  features when feasible. for example, our  newly constructed distribution centers  and processing centers are built to include  the addition of onsite solar arrays where  possible. furthermore, when we move into  existing properties, as part of the renovation  process, our design teams typically  consider ways to improve energy efficiency  and water conservation and to develop  recycling infrastructure where feasible.  reducing emissions: in our value chain our focus has historically been on the climate-related impact of our direct operations where we have the  most control over our facilities energy and fuel usage (scope   and scope  ). in addition, we have begun  to evaluate how our commitment to reduce our scope   and   emissions might be extended to certain  scope   emissions sources as well. through a high-level screening of all   scope   emissions categories, we  have begun to develop a preliminary understanding of which of those categories of scope   emissions are rele- vant to our business. we are also making progress in collecting publicly available information about the climate  strategies, reduction targets, and emissions data for some of our largest vendors. these efforts are intended to  help us evaluate our ability to collect data and measure certain sources of emissions from scope   categories.  transportation and fuel our logistics teams worldwide seek out strategies and technology solutions that can help us increase the  efficiency of our logistics and transportation operations and reduce fuel used to transport our merchandise  throughout our distribution network. we strive to conserve fuel, reduce travel time, and decrease the number  of trucks on the road. we use a variety of strategies and technologies to support this initiative, for example,  using modeling software to improve the efficiency of our store delivery network, increasing utilization of trailer  space, and testing new alternative fuel vehicles.  in the u.s., we have opened service centers that are smaller than distribution centers in addition to  using intermodal.  these service centers are located closer to store clusters and designed to improve  the efficiency of our store delivery process. we also utilize these service centers to co-locate our asset  recovery and recycling centers (arrcs) and maximize our delivery trucks’ utilization by backhauling  re-usable and recyclable materials.     global corporate responsibility report /       /       other efforts include:  / we engage directly with our logistics partners and indirectly through third parties (such as u.s.  environmental protection agency’s (epa) smartway transport partnership and natural resource  canada’s fleetsmart program) to identify opportunities to reduce fuel consumption and increase  fuel efficiencies.    /in  ,  % of tjx’s u.s. freight and logistics ton-mileage was with smartway-certified carriers. to  achieve this result, tjx collaborated with carriers to encourage their participation in this program. tjx  requires that all new u.s. carriers are smartway-certified.  /where feasible, we use rail and intermodal for shipping merchandise, which is generally more fuel  efficient and produces fewer emissions than trucking. we estimate that in fiscal  , intermodal  shipping resulted in  ,  fewer metric tons of co e emissions than shipping the same volume  by truck only. in the u.k. and ireland, we work to reduce and conserve fuels in our owned fleet vehicles, and our agree- ment with our carrier for our trucking and store delivery trucks has a “sustainability” clause relating to  achievement of key environmental goals. third-party verification and assurance of emissions data  /in fiscal  ,  % of our global scope   and  % of our global scope  ,                               location-based emissions data are third-party verified.   /our scope   and scope   u.s. and canada ghg inventory data is third-party verified (using  aicpa (at ) standards). this initiative has resulted in tjx obtaining third-party verification for  approximately  % of our global scope   emissions (onsite fuels, refrigerants, and transport  fuels) and an estimated  % of our global scope   emissions (electricity and steam calculated  using location-based emissions factors) for our fiscal   reporting period.  /in europe, our carbon footprint has been assessed by the carbon trust since  . additionally,  since  , we have achieved the carbon trust standard certificate, recognizing our year-on-year  efforts to reduce our environmental impact in the u.k., and since  , the certification has included  our entire scope   and   european operations.  /additionally, we also third-party verify about  % of our scope

through our network of asset recovery and recycling centers (arrcs) to be returned to  distribution centers for reuse. this effort not only was good for the environment, but it also resulted  in nearly $  million in cost avoidance. r   global corporate responsibility report /       /       maximizing reuse and recycling we have many programs across our global business that support our efforts to reuse and recycle our  operational waste in our stores, distribution centers, and home offices. for example, recycling programs  for common items like cardboard, plastic, paper, aluminum, and glass have been introduced across all  geographies. we are working to improve our programs and find new ways to recycle other items, like  polystyrene. one of our efforts involves our asset recovery recycling centers (arrcs). in the u.s., our   arrcs are located within our service centers and have historically served as a central  destination for regional recyclable or reusable store material. select stores send used corrugated cardboard,  plastic, excess hangers, store fixtures, display cases, unused boxes, and other supplies to their local arrc,  where the items are processed for reuse in other stores or recycled. over the years, the flexibility of the arrc organization has enabled us to test new programs as we strive  to increase the types of materials that can be included in our recycling stream. for example, as our global  waste stakeholders have identified polystyrene (styrofoam) as a key area of focus, we have leveraged the  arrc to pilot strategies to improve our management and recycling of polystyrene packaging material.  thanks to efforts like this and many others, we estimate the arrcs have helped divert more than  ,   metric tons of waste from landfills since fiscal  . in europe, the arrc operates as a reuse center for equipment that is not currently required in certain  stores and fulfills other stores equipment needs. the arrc also operates as a distribution and storage  function for non-stock items, such as merchandise protection. /our three distribution centers in ontario, canada, achieved a  % diversion rate.  /in our european processing centers,  we divert approximately  % of waste from landfills and  recycle plastic, wooden pallets, and cardboard that has been backhauled from our stores. decreasing single-use plastics we have regional efforts in place to identify opportunities to remove single-use plastics from our operations  and are working with our suppliers to reduce single-use packaging.  /in the u.s., we have a team who is working to improve the sustainability of the packaging used  for certain products which supports our global goal to shift  % of the packaging for products  developed in-house by our product design team to be reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable  materials by  . read more about our work in this area on our responsible sourcing page.  /in our u.s. distribution centers, we utilize a more easily recycled material and corrugated box insert  for the packaging of liquid products during shipping from distribution centers to stores that has resulted  in an estimated   million fewer plastic bags being used across our distribution network each year.  /in canada, we established a single-use plastics committee in fiscal   comprised of represent- atives across several functional areas who are helping to drive our strategy around this topic. the  group is reviewing where single-use plastics are used in our canadian business and operations, and  exploring and proposing

solutions that support a more circular economy. for example, in cer - tain parts of canada, u.k., and ireland, we have programs in place that support the reuse of clothing,  accessories, shoes, homeware, and more. in canada , we partner with brands for canada at our distribution centers to provide second life for product  by donating unsold clothing, personal care, and household items to people in need through trusted social  service agencies and schools. additionally, in an effort to streamline our store charity donations we have  partnered with habitat for humanity to collect and manage our store donations across canada.  in the u.k. and ireland , our long-running give up clothes for good campaign invites customers  and associates to donate their pre-loved quality fashion and homeware at their local t.k. maxx, which  could be sold by cancer research u.k. to raise funds for research into children’s and young people’s  cancers. as of fiscal  , t.k. maxx associates and customers have donated  .  million bags of  goods. this amounts to  ,  metric tons of pre-loved items diverted from landfill. the initiative not only  benefits the environment because it may keep pre-loved items from going to landfill, but has also raised  millions of pounds for cancer research u.k. for children and young people and enable ireland.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       reducing water consumption although our business operations are not water intensive, we believe reducing water usage is consistent  with both our commitment to environmental sustainability and our low-cost operating philosophy. to that  end, we work to monitor our water usage and identify opportunities to improve water efficiency where  possible across our operations. for instance, our energy management groups in the u.s. and u.k.     monitor water usage across our home office buildings to identify opportunities to conserve water including  time-sensor technologies to control faucets in many of our restrooms. additionally, our tjx vendor code of conduct  strongly encourages our merchandise vendors to  conserve and protect resources, such as water and energy, and also take into consideration environ- mental issues that may impact their local communities. environmental concerns are incorporated into  our merchandise vendor social compliance training materials as well, introducing high-level concepts  of environmental sustainability, like water conservation. our training includes specific cost-saving,  water-conservation recommendations for our suppliers that they may consider implementing at their  production facilities. we plan to continue including similar relevant water facts during future training  sessions. plastics cleanup efforts as part of our efforts, tjx europe has supported a number of projects committed to reducing plastic and  waste including:  /ocean clean up:  a non-profit organization with a mission to clean the world’s oceans of plastic.

responsibility report   global corporate responsibility report delivering real value  to the world tjx is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions worldwide, with seven retail chains operating  nearly  ,  stores in nine countries spanning three continents. as an off-price leader and a fortune    company, we recognize the obligation we have to our key stakeholders – including associates, customers,  communities, vendors, and shareholders – to operate a responsible business. our business dealings and interactions are grounded in our long-held core values of honesty, integrity, and  treating others with dignity and respect. we hold ourselves to high ethical standards and expect our associates  to comply with these standards, which are set forth in the  tjx global code of conduct.  likewise, our vendor  code of conduct sets our expectations of the vendors with whom we do business and whose relationships are  key to our success. we provide periodic training, both formal and informal, to reinforce these expectations. responsible business initiatives at tjx, operating responsibly includes focus in the following areas:   % of board members  are

/       responsible sourcing tjx believes in the importance of responsible  and ethical sourcing in our supply chain. we  strongly value the relationships that we have  developed with our vendors, which are built on a  foundation of honesty, trust, and ethical business  practices. we believe these relationships have  been a key factor in our long-term success.  our responsible sourcing initiatives cover a variety of  evolving areas of interest. these include our long-stand- ing global social compliance program, as well as newer  initiatives related to the environmental impact of certain  products and packaging and chemicals management within our operations.    responsible sourcing and social compliance are tremendously challenging undertakings. our  efforts are rooted in continuous improvement, which we believe can be achieved by making our  commitments clear to our vendors, buying agent(s), and associates; through our auditing  and training efforts; by responding to issues as appropriate for our business; and by contin- uing to assess opportunities to enhance reporting. global social compliance  program our global social compliance program is rooted in our vendor code of conduct, which out- lines our expectations for our vendors. it also includes our expectations for our merchandise  factory monitoring and supplier training program, which is focused where we have more influ- ence in bringing the products to market. this means our auditing and training typically reaches  factories that produce merchandise that we have helped design or develop to be manufactured  just for us. we believe this is where we are most likely to be able to have a meaningful impact.  while we do not own, operate, or control any facilities that manufacture products we sell, we  collaborate closely with our buying agent(s) and international buying offices because they have  strong relationships with local production facilities and are well positioned to reinforce our expec- tations.  how we buy: our  off-price business model tjx is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the u.s. and worldwide. our mission is to deliver  great value to our customers every day. we do this by offering ever-changing selections of high quality, fashion- able, brand name, and designer merchandise at prices generally  % to  % below full-price retailers’ (including  department, specialty, and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day.  , + buying associates ~ ,  vendors   + countries u   global corporate responsibility report /       /       the majority of product we sell in our stores and online is brand-name merchandise. to obtain this merchandise,  we work closely with our vendors and take advantage of a wide variety of opportunities, which can include depart- ment store cancellations, a manufacturer making up too much product, or a closeout deal when a vendor wants  to clear merchandise at the end of a season. there are other ways we bring tremendous value to our customers.  for example, sometimes when what we are seeing in the marketplace is not the right value for our customers,  meaning the right combination of brand, fashion, price, and quality, we may help design or develop merchandise  to be manufactured just for us. on a worldwide basis, in fiscal  , more than  ,  associates in our buying organization sourced product  from a universe of approximately  ,  vendors and more than   countries around the world. as part of tjx’s  purchase order terms and conditions, our merchandise vendors are required to comply with our vendor code  of conduct. the vendor code of conduct requires that goods we sell have been manufactured and shipped in  accordance with all applicable laws, regulations, and, including, among other things, a commitment to respect the  rights of the workers who manufacture products for sale in our stores and online. these requirements stand even  if a vendor applies their own code of conduct, monitoring, or ethical sourcing guidelines. our vendors are also  required to ensure that any factories or subcontractors they use comply with our code’s principles. sustainable products and  packaging we are taking initial steps to determine ways that we may reduce the environmental impact of certain products  and product packaging. as we source merchandise, product packaging, and supplies for our own operations,  we may find more opportunities to procure materials with sustainable attributes. as some of our first steps  along this journey:  /we aim to shift  % of the packaging for products developed in-house by our product design team to be  reusable, recyclable, or contain sustainable materials by  .  /we have implemented our plan to phase out all phenol-based coatings on paper customer sales receipts in  the u.s. and intend to complete this process in canada by the end of fiscal  .   /by  , we plan to phase out use of pvc in packaging of certain soft home products designed by tjx’s  own fashion and style experts and specifically manufactured for us. this will include certain top-of-bed  styles, easy-care table linens, outdoor seating cushions, and outdoor pillows. in addition to our global targets for certain product packaging, we have developed a framework to define  sustainable product attributes, which includes materials that can be verified by a credible third-party process  or certification. our subject matter experts have compiled a list of preferred sustainable product certifications in  certain product categories that can be used across all of our divisions, globally. examples include forest stew- ardship council (fsc)-certified materials; global recycled standard (grs)-certified products; oeko-tex-certi- fied products; and products made from organic cotton.  some examples of materials we are using with these preferred environmental attributes include:  /we have sourced fsc hangtags where feasible with certain products our style and fashion experts have  designed.  /a significant portion of our price tickets are printed on fsc-certified paper.  /in t.j. maxx and marshalls within the u.s., we have converted some of our gift card styles to be printed on  fsc-certified stock.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       chemicals management since we operate a large, complex, international business, we focus our efforts in areas where we believe we  can have a meaningful impact and that are most feasible for our business model. as we continue to learn and  build our programs in this area, we are exploring ways to manage chemicals of concern that go beyond legal  and regulatory requirements in our operations as well as certain products we sell. chemicals management has been identified as a strategic priority by our global environmental sustainability  committee (gesc), a team of subject matter experts from each of our major geographies who lead the strate- gic direction of our environmental sustainability program, and a sub-committee of that group is leading the as- sessment of potential areas across our global business where we can limit chemicals of concern. teams across  the business support these efforts by developing tactics that support the company’s initiatives and demonstrate  the company’s ongoing progress around chemicals management. chemicals management oversight is led by  our chief risk and compliance officer and our vice president of sustainability, who regularly provide updates  to the sevp , group president, who was asked to lead and oversee tjx’s environmental sustainability initiatives,  among other esg initiatives.  our current approach includes:  /program development including addressing opportunities in:  /business operations  /merchandise and packaging  /industry, expert, and internal collaboration program development to aid in the development of policies limiting chemicals of concern in our operations and in certain products we  sell, we are utilizing the chemical footprint project (cfp) framework, specifically leveraging the management  strategy section to review relevant industry focus areas. late in calendar year  , we published tjx’s chemicals management program. the program out- lines our expectations for vendors and suppliers to reduce or eliminate certain chemicals of concern and also  identifies the initial prioritization of categories where we intend to focus our efforts. we encourage all of tjx’s  suppliers and vendors to become familiar with this program as well as the best practices for safer chemicals  management applicable to their industry and product type. we will continue to evolve our strategy and work  to identify new and expanded policies and commitments where we may further limit the use of chemicals of  concern within our complex off-price business model. we will continue to update tjx’s chemicals management  program as new commitments in this area and additional policies are finalized. initiatives within our business operations phase  :  /we have implemented our plan to phase out all phenol-based coatings

corporate responsibility report /       /       evolving issues bangladesh the tragedies that have taken place in factories in bangladesh are reminders that we must remain vigilant  and continue to monitor whether our policies and practices are adequate and appropriate. worker health  and safety have always been a significant part of tjx’s global social compliance program. our audit programs are based on evolving industry recommendations, including auditing the fire safety prac- tices of factories. we stress the importance of fire safety in our external supplier and internal buyer training  programs and have posted a message about our workplace safety expectations on our vendor intranet site.  our vendor code of conduct includes a statement that expands our requirements for providing safe and  healthy conditions beyond the factory to include any living facilities provided to workers. going forward, we  plan to continue to follow the various initiatives of the retail industry to glean any insights that might enhance  our own global social compliance program. conflict minerals  at tjx, we are committed to complying with the rules and regulations impacting our business, including  those under section   of the dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, intended  to address violence and human rights abuses in the democratic republic of the congo (the drc) and  adjoining countries. these rules require public companies to determine if they manufacture or contract  to manufacture any products where “conflict minerals” - specifically tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold (or  “ tg”) - are necessary to the functionality or production of the product, and if so, whether those minerals  originated in the drc or adjoining countries. companies are required to do additional diligence about the  source and chain of custody of those minerals that may have originated in the covered region to deter - mine if they came from sources that benefited armed forces in the region. as demonstrated by the tjx vendor code of conduct and our global social compliance program, we  believe in responsible sourcing. tjx is many layers removed from the mining, smelting, or refining of any  minerals contained in the products we sell, so we must rely on our vendors to collect current, complete,  and reliable information to comply with these rules. we expect that our affected vendors will not knowingly  supply us with products that include conflict minerals that directly or indirectly benefit armed groups in the  drc or adjoining countries, although we do not discourage responsible sourcing from that region. we  further expect our vendors and buying agent(s) to comply with our requests to provide us with information  and perform due diligence regarding their sourcing of the minerals at issue. we will consider appropriate  remediation steps if we find that a vendor has violated this policy. fur practices  tjx’s businesses around the world are fur-free. our businesses also do not knowingly source goods con- taining angora (rabbit) fibers. from time to time, our businesses may offer products containing shearling,  haircalf, or hide. the process of procuring merchandise for our off-price model is complex, and if an item  containing fur is mistakenly sent to our stores or e-commerce sites, we work quickly to remove the item.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       we are also committed to continuous improvement in the ethical sourcing of products intended for sale  in our businesses, and as part of our ongoing considerations regarding animal welfare, we incorporated  information about our fur practices into our social compliance training in  . importantly, at all times,  tjx is committed to conducting business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,  including but not limited to, animal protection laws. modern slavery statement  (california transparency in supply chains act

efforts of the tjx companies, inc. and  its consolidated subsidiaries to address modern slavery because we take a global approach to modern  slavery compliance. the reporting entities come within our global social compliance program. about our business. tjx is an off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions with nearly  ,  stores  across three continents in nine countries offering a rapidly changing assortment of merchandise. we  source merchandise from a varying and expansive universe of approximately  ,  vendors and more  than   countries. as an off-price retailer, we have a complex global business model that is quite different  from other traditional retailers that, unlike tjx, may own, operate, or control the facilities that manufacture  products sold in their stores and/or may purchase products from a generally consistent vendor base. our  strategies to acquire merchandise are intentionally flexible to allow our buying organization to react to  frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what is acquired as well  as when it is acquired. sometimes, when what we are seeing in the marketplace is not the right value for  our customers, meaning the right combination of brand, fashion, price, and quality, we may help design or  develop merchandise to be manufactured just for us. our commitment. at tjx, we are committed to treating people with dignity, fairness, and respect. both  our tjx global code of conduct, which applies to all of our employees (associates) worldwide, and our  vendor code of conduct, which applies to our merchandise vendors, reflect these principles and prohibit  involuntary or forced labor. we are aware of reports of modern slavery in apparel supply chains and, as  described below, our global social compliance program underscores our efforts to address and mitigate  these risks, and where appropriate, take corrective action. we believe that modern slavery risks in our  own workforce are minimal due to the strength of our internal employment policies and procedures. our global social compliance program. our global social compliance program includes, among  other things, our factory audit program, our vendor code of conduct, our training efforts, and our grievance  mechanisms for vendors. as part of our program including as part of assessing its effectiveness, we regularly  review factory audits performed, remediation efforts taken, and vendor training attendance. our global social  compliance committee, which includes senior leadership, meets on a regular basis to oversee this program  and review trends in social compliance. in addition to our global social compliance committee, we also have a  global corporate responsibility executive steering committee to help guide our global corporate responsibility  strategies and align them with tjx business priorities, oversee corporate responsibility efforts across functions  and geographies, facilitate information exchange, and support enhanced corporate responsibility reporting. this  committee is comprised of senior executives representing functions across the company, including two exec- utive officers reporting directly to the ceo. these executive officers are positioned to update management  and the board on the ongoing work of the committee.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       to help us evaluate and address the risks of modern slavery in our merchandise supply chain, our actions  have included membership in external multi-stakeholder initiatives that share resources and best prac- tices to improve efforts to combat forced labor, including the joint aafa/nrf/rila/usfia forced labor  working group, the responsible business alliance’s responsible labor initiative, retail industry leaders  association (“rila”) responsible sourcing committee, and the american apparel and footwear associ- ation social responsibility committee. tjx is also an ambassador sponsor of the responsible sourcing  network’s yess initiative, which aims to train, support, and enable spinners and mills in the middle tiers of  the supply chain to end forced labor at the raw cotton level. vendor code of conduct. as a condition of conducting business with tjx and as a means of self certifica- tion, our merchandise vendors are required to agree to comply with our vendor code of conduct which  prohibits involuntary or forced labor, including labor obtained through slavery or human trafficking. our  vendor code of conduct further requires that the goods our merchandise vendors sell to us have been  manufactured in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, which include those pertaining to  involuntary labor, forced labor, or human trafficking. it also requires that merchandise vendors ensure that  all subcontractors and any other third parties they use in the production or distribution of goods offered  for sale in our stores comply with the principles described in the vendor code of conduct. hich prohibits  involuntary or forced labor, including labor obtained through slavery or human trafficking. our vendor code  of conduct further requires that the goods our merchandise vendors sell to us have been manufactured  in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, which include those pertaining to involuntary labor,  forced labor, or human trafficking. it also requires that merchandise vendors ensure that all subcontrac- tors and any other third parties they use in the production or distribution of goods offered for sale in our  stores comply with the principles described in the vendor code of conduct. third-party audits. our global social compliance program includes factory auditing. we focus our factory  auditing where we have more influence in bringing the products to market. this means our program typically  reaches factories that produce merchandise that we have helped design or develop to be manufactured just  for us. we focus our auditing efforts on these factories because we believe this is where we are most likely  to be able to have a meaningful impact. we contract with both leading independent auditors (including ul,  intertek, and omega) and other third parties (such as our buying agent) to conduct these social compliance  audits and we also accept audit reports from recognized audit sources, including bsci, wrap , and sedex.  these social compliance audits evaluate and address risks of modern slavery. in fiscal year  , we reviewed  more than  ,  audits. over the last two decades, we have conducted or accepted tens of thousands of  audits. we maintain a global social compliance manual, which is available in seven languages and contains an  audit procedure outline and factory evaluation checklist to help factories better understand our vendor  code of conduct and prepare for audits conducted on our behalf by ul, intertek, and omega. the audits  are conducted on an unannounced basis during specified time windows, where possible, and they are  intended to verify the factory’s compliance with the standards contained in our vendor code of conduct,  including our prohibition of involuntary or forced labor. to this end, factory audits consider, among other  things, whether workers are responsible for any fees associated with their recruitment and evaluate policies  related to passport retention. vendors are expected to cooperate fully with the audits and to provide the  auditors with full access to their facilities, employees, and documentation. factory audits include employee  interviews in order to hear first-hand about worker treatment. we recently enhanced our audit program,  with additional forced labor questions based on recommendations from industry groups. when we accept  factory audit reports from recognized third party audit sources, the audit report is evaluated against our  own internal audit requirements to determine the factory’s audit score. the factory’s score on the initial  audit determines timing for re-assessment, according to a risk-based audit cycle we have developed. our    global corporate responsibility report /       /       policy is to take appropriate steps should we learn that a vendor is failing to meet our standards. these  steps may include remediation, cancellation of purchase orders, or termination of our business relationship. tjx global code of conduct. our tjx global code of conduct prohibits behavior that creates an  intimidating or hostile work environment, and it requires tjx associates to obey all applicable laws and  regulations of the countries in which we operate, including wage and hour rules. in choosing third parties  to work with, our associates are also expected to select those that act with integrity and in a manner con- sistent with the ethical principles stated in our global code of conduct. tjx reviews reported concerns  and takes appropriate action depending on the nature and severity of the violation. training. we provide regular training for associates, including management, involved in the development  and buying of merchandise, as well as cyclical training for our buying agent, certain vendors, and their  factory representatives around the world. typically, we hold an average of  -  training sessions a year,  focusing on various locations around the world that are regionally close to factories included in our factory  monitoring program. among other things, this training provides guidance on recognizing and mitigating  the risks of modern slavery. due to the covid-  global pandemic, we initiated virtual training in fiscal  year  , which continued in fiscal year  . grievance mechanisms. tjx associates are encouraged to raise any concerns without fear of retaliation  and have multiple channels to do so, including an ethics hotline staffed by independent third-party oper - ators. external stakeholders, including vendor personnel, may reach us via any of the phone numbers or  addresses listed by locality on the “contact us” section of our corporate website.  while an overview of our efforts is provided here in

social compliance mirrors our culture, and just as we are committed to honesty, integrity,  and treating others with dignity and respect, we expect those that we do business with to do the same. we  have reviewed and incorporated many of the international human rights standards enunciated by international  bodies, such as the united nations and the international labour organization. our commitment to these  principles is reflected in our vendor code of conduct, which serves as the foundation for our program and  our responsible sourcing initiatives. program oversight our senior vice president (svp), chief risk and compliance officer has responsibility for social compliance  across our global operations, including our global social compliance program. the svp periodically  reports to our board of directors on various aspects of our program, which may include training efforts,  audit results, and other compliance-related topics. our global social compliance program is part of our  ongoing enterprise risk assessment. program management is overseen by the assistant vice president (avp), global social compliance,  who works closely with representatives of our merchandise and purchasing functions across all of tjx’s  businesses and with the global social compliance committee. this committee is comprised of senior  leadership representing the u.s., canada, and europe and

received, and at times incorporated, insights and suggestions from  investors. for our audits conducted by third-party auditors, we have retained and engage with several  organizations that have extensive experience and expertise in the field of ethical sourcing – ul llc,  intertek group plc, and omega compliance ltd. additionally, these groups assist us with program  development, education and training, and compliance monitoring. we are members of the national retail federation, the retail industry leaders association (rila),  ethisphere’s business ethics leadership alliance, boston

auditing portion of our  global social compliance program   where we have more influence in  bringing the products to market. this  means our program typically reaches  factories that produce merchandise  that we have helped design or devel- op just for us. we focus our auditing  efforts on these factories because  we believe this is where we are most  likely to be able to have a meaningful impact. when we source these products, we require  the buying agents and vendors that are involved to identify any active factories that they use,  or intend to use, to produce such merchandise. together with our representatives, ul llc, intertek group plc, and omega  compliance limited, we work closely with our agents and vendors so that  they understand our global social compliance program, our vendor code  of conduct, and our factory auditing process. our internal teams also play  an important role in educating vendors on our program requirements and  encouraging them to make improvements at their facilities, when necessary.  additionally, we have associates that support the program in various buying  offices around the world. our tjx global social compliance manual contains, among other important  guidance, an audit procedure outline and factory evaluation checklist to help  prepare the factory for the audit process. this tool is available in seven languag- es and offers detailed information designed to help agents, vendors, and  factory management in our audit program better understand the expectations  of our vendor code of conduct, as well as our monitoring and corrective  action processes. we require our buying agents to disseminate this manual to  their entire tjx vendor base and have it posted to our vendor website, which  is available to all vendors. factory auditing process factories included in our audit program are required to undergo periodic audits to ensure adherence to  our vendor code of conduct and local laws. we reviewed

to adhere to all quality and ethical requirements outlined  in apsca’s code and standards of professional conduct. the vast majority of audits conducted on  behalf of tjx are by apsca registered auditors (ra), currently the highest apsca achievable level.  we have developed comprehensive compliance program guidelines for our third-party factory auditors  and regularly review and modify these guidelines for consistency with evolving social compliance issues  and trends. factories are expected to cooperate fully with us and our auditors and to provide access to  facilities and documents. these audits generally include one to two full working days at each audited factory, whether in-person or  remote, and include the following components:  /interview with factory management  /policy, payroll, and documentation review, including confirmation that factory management has verified  the ages of job applicants before hiring to protect against potential hiring of child labor  /factory walk-through  /health and safety inspection  /chemical and hazardous materials review, including usage information and verification of material  safety data sheets, chemical safety, and hazardous waste programs  /confidential worker interviews  /debrief with factory management our avp , global social compliance, and certain associates that support our program in buying offices  around the world participate in shadow audits with auditors. shadowing is practiced to gain a better  understanding of the compliance audit process and challenges, and to better aid tjx in our review of both  our audit results and, more broadly, our program’s effectiveness. corrective action and remediation audit reports are reviewed by tjx and assigned a rating of satisfactory, needs improvement, or unsat- isfactory. for factories assessed as satisfactory, our goal is to conduct biennial audits. when a factory  receives a needs improvement or unsatisfactory rating, a corrective action plan (cap) is created and  concerns are discussed by the auditors with factory management. a copy of the cap is provided to  factory management to assist them in resolving any violations or deficiencies detected during the audit.  to encourage collaboration between our buying agents and vendors, a copy of the cap is also forwarded  to both parties’ attention shortly following the audit. tjx receives a copy as well. factory management is  requested to sign the cap to verify their understanding of the findings. for factories with a needs improvement rating, our buying agents or direct vendors are expected to  provide evidence to us that remedial action has been carried out within six months of the audit. however,  where moderate to more serious violations of the vendor code of conduct or the local laws are detected,  meaning the factory has received an unsatisfactory rating, we require that our third-party representatives  re-audit the factory or require a follow-up audit from an accredited, third-party source and aim to complete    global corporate responsibility report /       /       the re-audit within   months. at the conclusion of each audit, factories are notified of the issues found and  of the expectation of remedial action. we expect that continuous improvement is verified during the re-audit. our general goal is that each  re-audit demonstrates measurable improvement from the prior audit. we recognize that if a factory  receives several consecutive noncompliant grades, this pattern may suggest that required remedial action  is not being undertaken. though we strive to work with vendors to address and resolve shortcomings in their operations, under  extreme circumstances, we may conclude that our merchandise can no longer be produced in certain  factories, or that they will be precluded from producing goods for us until they demonstrate that they  have addressed the situation and have put management systems in place to prevent a recurrence. our  preferred approach, however, is to work with vendors whenever possible to address and resolve issues  identified during audits because improving working conditions in factories is an ongoing effort and tjx,  like other retailers, continues to face this challenge. we believe this is preferable to ceasing use of these  factories as it gives us the ability to influence positive change. we believe that this “continuous improve - ment” model is in the interest of the workers in the facilities from which we source goods. there are several issues that we consider to be “zero tolerance” issues: for example, bribery/corruption;  child labor and forced or slave labor; human trafficking; maintaining a facility with all doors and/or exits  locked; use of chemicals banned in the region; and failure to pay wages. if a factory is found to be in  violation of our requirements on these topics, we inform our vendor that it can no longer provide us with  goods made by that factory. encouraging environmental responsibility in keeping with our commitment to protect the environment, audits conducted on behalf of tjx include  a review of factory policies, practices, and procedures concerning the handling of chemicals and other  hazardous waste, and a review of whether the factory is in compliance with applicable environmental laws  and regulations. our vendor code of conduct strongly encourages our vendors to share our commitment  to protecting the environment by operating in a sustainable manner where possible, for example by  conserving and protecting resources, such as water and energy, and taking into consideration environ- mental issues that may impact local communities. our social compliance training program has been  expanded to include coverage of the protection and conservation of water, as well as an overview of the  legal requirements on the use of chemicals and hazardous materials in the regions where products are  both manufactured and sold. training includes case studies to assist vendors and factory management in  better understanding our expectations and our vendor code of conduct requirements in this area.    global corporate responsibility report /       /       social compliance  training we recognize that it is important to  routinely train buying agents, vendors,  and factory management, and we  strongly encourage all new factories  in our factory monitoring program to  participate in such training. typically,  we hold an average of  -  training  sessions a year, focusing on various  locations around the world that are  regionally close to factories included  in our factory monitoring program. in  fiscal  , training sessions were held  remotely due to the covid-   pandemic. these training sessions are conducted by ul representatives in partnership with our assistant  vice president (avp), global social compliance. we believe the presence of our management  at these sessions demonstrates to factory management, buying agent management, and  vendors that tjx is committed to our global social compliance program. over time, our  training sessions have been held in various locations (see map for examples) and have  included the following topics:  /together with our representatives, ul llc, intertek group plc, and omega compliance limited, we work    tjx’s vendor code of conduct and the expectations contained in this code  /local labor laws  /anti-bribery laws (including the foreign corrupt practices act and the u.k. bribery act)  /regulations on chemicals and hazardous materials, material data safety sheets, hazardous waste         management, and required environmental permits  /business ethics  /tjx’s policy against forced and involuntary labor, including slavery and human trafficking  /fire safety  /water conservation recommendations  /tjx’s fur practices  /factory compliance best practices and preventative actions  /case studies to help demonstrate how to embed management remediation systems  /open discussions with vendors and factory management on compliance challenges in addition to the above, we often include targeted training based on geographic or other regional differences  to ensure that we are covering the most pertinent topics for each training session, and we may break into focus  groups to enhance training through shared learning. x   global corporate responsibility report /       /       designated representatives at various buying offices around the globe also provide instruction to vendors and  factory management on our ethical sourcing expectations. we plan to continue to devote resources to these  important training initiatives and to review and update these initiatives as appropriate. associate training tjx associates involved in the development and buying of merchandise are expected to undergo formal social  compliance training biennially. in addition, through informal meetings and discussions, our avp , global social  compliance continues to share our learnings, updating our product development and buying associates on the  requirements of tjx’s global social compliance program. in fiscal  , we began expanding our training efforts through new partnerships with external stakeholders.  through our sponsorship of the responsible sourcing network’s yarn ethically and sustainably sourced (yess)  initiative, we were able to offer associates that support our global social compliance program access to  information sessions about yess’ work assisting mills and spinners in identifying forced labor in their supply  chains. additionally, through our participation in the responsible business alliance’s responsible labor  initiative, associates that support our global social compliance program will have access to forced labor  training modules.   global corporate responsibility report /       /       vendor code of  conduct we expect high ethical standards from anyone with whom we do business. our vendor code  of conduct reflects those high standards, which embrace internationally recognized principles  designed to protect the interests of the workers who manufacture products for sale in our  businesses. these principles have been informed by, and in many instances incorporate,    human rights, labor rights, and anti-corruption standards enunciated by the united nations  and other respected international bodies, such as the international labour organization and  its core standards. we are committed to respecting the rights of all workers, including the  rights of women and children, who can be especially vulnerable in the retail manufacturing  supply chain. acceptance of our vendor code of conduct is part of our purchase order terms and conditions for merchandise  vendors. while the specific requirements contained in the code were developed with merchandise vendors in  mind, we expect all of the companies and individuals with whom we do business to act with integrity and ad- here to the basic principles that underlie each code requirement. those basic principles include a commitment  to act in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations; respect for the human rights and well-being of all  people; and consideration of one’s impact on the environment. as with all of our corporate responsibility programs, we are committed to continuous improvement. with that  in mind, we periodically benchmark our vendor code of conduct against the codes of many industry peers to  better understand the common practices in the industry and identify where our programs are aligned. these  efforts help us prioritize additional areas of focus, and support enhancements made to our vendor code of  conduct, as recently as  . we plan to continue to evaluate further potential amendments we may want to  make in the future. we encourage anyone with questions or concerns relating to our vendor code of conduct to contact us at  complianceofficer@tjx.com. the tjx companies, inc. vendor  code of conduct tjx requires that all products offered for sale in our stores be produced in facilities that meet specific criteria, as  set forth below: compliance with applicable laws

labor our vendors must not use child labor. the term “child” is defined as anyone younger than   years of age (or  younger than   years of age where the law of the country of manufacture allows  -year-olds to work). at all  times our vendors must respect compulsory education laws. workers under the age of   must not perform  hazardous work. forced labor our vendors must not use voluntary or involuntary prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, labor acquired  through slavery or human trafficking, or any forms of involuntary or forced labor. our vendors must not require  workers to surrender any identity papers as a condition of employment; such documents may only be tempo- rarily held to verify a worker’s employment eligibility. our vendors must reimburse their workers for any recruit- ment or hiring fees that are paid. wages and benefits our vendors must abide by all applicable laws relating to wages and benefits, and must pay the legally pre- scribed minimum wage or higher. workers must be provided with a written contract which clearly describes  their employment and wage terms prior to acceptance of employment. our vendors must not make any  deductions from wages as a disciplinary measure. working hours our vendors must not require their employees, on a regularly-scheduled basis, to work in excess of   hours  per week (or fewer hours if prescribed by applicable laws and regulations). all overtime must be voluntary and  must be fully compensated in accordance with the requirements of local law, and except in extraordinary cir - cumstances, employees must be entitled to at least one day of rest in every seven-day period. harassment or abuse our vendors must respect the rights and dignity of their employees. we will not tolerate human rights abuses,  including physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse of workers. discrimination workers must be employed, retained, and compensated based on their ability to perform their jobs, and must  not be discriminated against on the basis of gender, race, color, national origin, religious, ethnic or cultural   global corporate responsibility report /       /       beliefs,

with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, including maintaining  current environmental permits. our vendors must be in compliance with all laws related to the handling, storage,  and disposal of chemicals and other hazardous materials. our vendors must adopt reasonable practices, where  possible, to conserve and protect resources, such as water and energy; and mitigate negative environmental im- pacts to local communities. subcontractors our vendors must ensure that all subcontractors and any other third parties they use in the production or  distribution of goods offered for sale in our stores comply with the principles described in this code of con- duct. additionally, our private label vendors must disclose to tjx’s third-party auditors the names of all such  subcontractors, and third parties before social compliance audits are scheduled. monitoring and compliance tjx or its designated third party auditor or agent shall have the right to monitor and assess compliance with  these principles. our vendors must be transparent and honest in all communications with tjx, our auditors and  agents. a violation of this code of conduct may result in required corrective action, cancellation of purchase  order(s), and/or termination of the business relationship. reporting violations of this code of conduct can be reported through the tjx helpline at tjxethicsline.ethicspoint.com or  by calling (us #)  -tjx-  ( - - ).   global corporate responsibility report /       /       stakeholder  engagement we strongly believe that for our policies and prac- tices to be effective, they must evolve and be  informed by the perspectives of our many stake- holders, including our associates, customers,  investors, and others. therefore, we strive to  maintain an open dialogue with these important  groups to achieve our goals. engaging with our associates we believe associate engagement, relationship building, and our open-door philosophy are key to  maintaining our culture, whether in our stores, distribution centers, or offices around the world. we want  our associates to be informed about our businesses and encouraged to learn and grow through both  formal and informational interactions. we believe these efforts help strengthen our inclusive culture so  associates feel welcome, valued, and engaged. as such, we have many different ways to communicate  with and hear from our associates, which became even more vital as the covid-  pandemic impacted  how we interact in the workplace. as our office associates largely continued to work remotely in fiscal  , our in-person communications  events remained virtual. we were pleased to be able to continue engaging our remote associates through  town hall meetings, state of the company meetings, and ceo updates. additionally, we continued to  publish the thread, our global intranet, and the loop, a weekly e-newsletter, which disseminate an- nouncements and facilitate information and policy sharing; tjx geographic-specific publications, such as  tjxtra in europe; and weekly bulletins in various regions around the globe. yammer, a social media tool  we launched in fiscal   for office associates to share information and engage in virtual discussions,  became more active and helped foster relationship building amidst the pandemic. in our stores, we share important company information with and receive feedback from our associates  through socially distanced team huddles and in-store bulletin boards. these bulletin boards also feature  store news, like volunteer events, fundraising successes, new processes, and more. we also have programs  for associates to share ideas, including thoughts on how to further improve the customer experience, as well  as several in-store programs designed to motivate and reward our associates, stores, and districts.   z   global corporate responsibility report /       /       engaging with our customers our customers are very important to us, and engaging  with them allows us to address their changing prefer - ences, tastes, interests, and concerns. one way we  measure our success is by asking customers to rate  their experience using online customer satisfaction  surveys. based on what we hear from our customers,  we regularly provide store operations management  with feedback regarding store performance so they  may identify opportunities and address issues quickly  – and ultimately improve the in-store experience. this  input also allows us to develop clear customer expe- rience training for store managers, team leaders, and  associates. the data has also helped drive broad  improvements across many of our retail chains, including redesigning floor plans, creating small “shops,”  and changing lighting to better highlight products. we have carefully tested each initiative for how it can  drive excitement about our retail chains and products and continue to help deliver the experience we  know our customers love and have come to expect. additionally, each retail chain has a website that highlights important information (including our covid-   health and wellness protocols), seasonal offerings, store locations, and contact information for customer  service groups, and for some of our retail chains, the ability to shop online. our chains also leverage a variety  of social media channels for customer engagement and real-time feedback on shopping experiences. our engagement efforts are all in place so that we can continue to provide excellent service to our customers. engaging with our investors in addition to our public disclosures and corporate responsibility reporting, we speak regularly with  shareholders throughout each year via investor meetings, conferences, phone calls, and written  correspondence. held mostly in virtual formats in fiscal  , these interactions allow us to engage with  the investor community regarding our company’s financial performance and on environmental, social, and  governance (esg) matters. we listen to our shareholders’ insights and perspectives thoughtfully, considering  what is best for our many stakeholders and our company overall. information security and privacy information security and privacy are very important to tjx. we have many protocols in place that are  designed to help protect the security of our customers’ personal information. the privacy pages on our  retail brand websites describe our privacy policies pertaining to the personal information we collect about  our customers. for many years, we have maintained an information management program, led by our chief risk and  compliance officer (cco) and information risk management director. this program is overseen by tjx’s  information management steering committee, which meets regularly and includes a number of senior    global corporate responsibility report /       /       leaders, including the data protection officer, chief information security officer (ciso), and director of  internal audit. this committee is responsible for developing and overseeing strategies to help tjx’s  information management program enhance the overall privacy, information security, and records  management posture of tjx. our cco and ciso regularly report to the audit committee of our board  of directors. our information management program incorporates several components, including: privacy: our privacy policies address the types of personal information we collect from customers, how  we may use that information, with whom we share that information, how we protect that information, and  how individuals can exercise their rights in regards to their personal information. we don’t generate revenue  by selling personal information. information security: while cyber threats are constantly evolving and no retailer can guarantee perfect  security, we have a multi-faceted approach designed to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the  personal information that we collect from customers. this approach includes measures like encryption for  certain types of personal information, controls over access to tjx facilities and systems, along with other  threat and risk-based safeguards. records management: our records management program consists of policies, guidelines, and practices  designed to promote both the retention of company records to meet legal and business requirements and  the timely deletion of records and other documents, with particular emphasis on minimizing the retention  of personal information where appropriate. in addition to these components, we perform selected audits and make training available to appropriate  tjx associates. audits: our internal audit team performs audits that address compliance with tjx information security  policies and, along with other teams, reviews certain third-party service providers with respect to their  security practices concerning personal information. associate training: privacy and information security training is made available to appropriate tjx  associates and is tailored to their job functions. this training is often supplemented with other education,  communications, and an internal information management website, all designed to help our associates  understand our expectations in this important area. engaging with our canadian associates one of the ways we engage with our canadian store associates is through the joy  project, which has inspired, motivated, and built associates’ morale. this in-store  program is focused on supporting the integral parts of our culture at tjx canada as  we strive to create an overall positive environment by recognizing store associates  for “spreading joy” through random acts of kindness, such as encouraging a  co-worker for a job well done or assisting a customer. further, in our canadian  distribution centers, our drive program (delivering results, innovation, and  value through engagement) seeks to identify best practices and efficiencies through  in-the-moment and planned conversations between managers and associates. our  goal in both of these programs is to drive the importance of building strong connections  between managers, associates, and customers.    global corporate responsibility report /       /       supplier diversity inclusion and diversity have long been a priority at tjx. the value we place on diversity extends  into all aspects of our organization, including our supplier relationships. our supplier diversity program is dedicated to broadening supplier options for not-for-resale goods and services.  since its inception in  , our program has expanded to help provide additional opportunities to businesses  owned by minorities, women, veterans, lgbtq+ individuals, and persons with disabilities. this, in turn, has  helped us identify suppliers for mutually beneficial relationships and has helped to promote economic development  in our suppliers’ local communities. in fiscal  , we expanded our supplier diversity program into canada and the u.k. and added partnerships  with several regional councils to help us identify certified diverse suppliers in those regions. supporting women-owned businesses for several years, tjx has participated in the corporate mentorship  program with the center for women & enterprise (cwe), a  massachusetts-based organization that pairs qualified companies  with certified women-owned businesses. this is a natural fit as cwe’s  mission of providing opportunities for women in business closely mirrors our efforts to support women in our  own workplace. in fiscal  , cwe identified a mentoring need at iterators llc, an inclusive, women-owned  small business that ensures websites and mobile apps are accessible to individuals with disabilities, and  matched iterators llc with tjx. the mentoring relationship focused on growing iterators llc’s business and  profitability, including how to articulate business value to clients and enhance marketing strategies. aa   global corporate responsibility report /       /       “my tjx mentor’s guidance allowed us to make changes and secure work we might not have sought  before, making our business more sustainable. perhaps the most valuable part for me was hearing my  mentor’s personal stories about business, which showed me how similar we are as humans and made me  more confident in speaking about my business.” jill wilcox, iterators llc supplier requirements  to support tjx’s goal of providing great value to our customers every day, our suppliers must demonstrate: / financial stability / proven history of successful projects / understanding of tjx’s business and practices / ability to provide high-quality, cost-competitive

recognize that  we must remain grounded in the same  principles on which our company was  founded – operating with high levels of  honesty and integrity, and treating others  with dignity and respect. we rely on the  talent and efforts of our associates, as  well as the example set by our leaders,  to help us live these principles every  day and foster the continued success  of our company. engagement with key  stakeholders has informed enhance- ments to our policies, practices, and  disclosures. our board of directors is responsible for over - seeing the business and management of the company. we believe our board should be composed of highly  engaged directors and that the board’s skills and experience be aligned with the changing needs of the company  for current and future business environments. as a global company with hundreds of thousands of associates  and operations on four continents, we consider inclusion and diversity to be part of who we are and core to our  culture. we look for a board that represents a diversity of backgrounds and experience, including as to gender  and race/ethnicity, and that reflects a range of talents, ages, skills, viewpoints, professional experiences,  geographies, and educational backgrounds. director qualifications and   nominations the corporate governance committee recommends to the board individuals to be director nominees who, in  the opinion of the committee, will be committed to the long-term success of our business and the best interests of  our shareholders. the committee considers a range of factors when considering individual candidates, including  personal and professional ethics, integrity, and values; independence; and diversity, including gender, ethnic,  racial, age, and geographic. the committee seeks nominees who have established strong professional reputations with experience in  substantive areas that are important to the long-term success of our complex, global business, such

a long history of strong corporate governance practices and policies. as part of our governance  practices, we are committed to high standards of ethics, which are reflected in the tjx global code of  conduct, code of ethics for tjx executives, director code of business conduct and ethics, and corporate  governance principles. specifically, our global code of conduct, which applies to all associates worldwide as  well as our board of directors, details our basic principles of honesty, integrity, and treating others with dignity  and respect and serves as a guide for ethical business conduct. the code is translated into over   languages,  and we provide periodic training, both formal and informal, to reinforce our expectations. our code of ethics for  tjx executives governs our executive chairman, chief executive officer and president, chief financial officer,  and other senior operating, financial, and legal executives who are also subject to our global code of conduct.  it is designed to ensure integrity in our financial reports and public disclosures. our director code of business  conduct and ethics is designed to promote honest and ethical conduct; compliance with applicable laws, rules,  and regulations; and the avoidance of conflicts of interest for our directors. our corporate governance principles provide expectations and guidelines for our board, such as duties and  expectations of service, including commitment of time, qualifications for independence, evaluation of perfor - mance, framework for meetings, committee structure, stock ownership guidelines, and other elements of our  board governance. each of the committees of our board of directors has a charter that sets forth, among other  things, the purpose and duties and responsibilities of the respective committee. many of the policies outlined in  our corporate governance principles, codes of conduct and ethics, and other governance documents create  an important
