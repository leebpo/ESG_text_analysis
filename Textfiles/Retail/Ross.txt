diversity, equality, and inclusion at ross, our values start with our people.  we are dedicated to supporting diverse teams and maintaining an inclusive company that respects, values, and celebrates the vast array of backgrounds, identities, and ideas of those who work for and shop with us. with our policies, programs, and procedures, we work to maintain a culture that promotes respect, equality, and dignity across our company and in each individual workplace. throughout our stores, distribution centers, and offices, we expect associates to exhibit our commitment to de&i in their interactions with customers and fellow associates alike.  our day-to-day work in this area is led  by the office of de&i, which continues to grow, and we are guided by two important bodies: the de&i steering committee and the de&i council. the de&i steering committee is co-chaired by our chief executive officer and chief operating officer and is comprised of senior executives from across the company who ensure that our de&i strategy is integrated into our culture and how we work. the de&i council, chaired by our group vice president of diversity, equality, and inclusion, includes cross-functional senior leaders who are responsible for developing  functional action plans that support our  de&i vision and objectives.  while ross has always been steadfast in  its commitment to de&i, we have made  significant progress in advancing our efforts  in recent years. for our efforts in  , we  were recognized by newsweek magazine as  one of “america’s greatest workplaces for  diversity” and one of “america’s greatest  workplaces for women.” we also received  a   out of   rating on the human rights  campaign foundation’s corporate equality  index, which rates workplaces on equality  and

business ethically empowering our associatesour commitment to diversity, equality, and inclusion nurturing a respectful culture  we aim to foster an environment where communication is  open and civil, conflict is addressed early and respectfully, and there is a culture of inclusion.  to that end, in  , we continued our commitment to  fostering de&i learning by providing training across all levels of the organization.  leaders across the company completed instructor- led inclusive leadership training. this training provides leaders with skills to maintain trusting and inclusive work environments that enable their teams to do their best work, while guiding them through the process of developing an action plan for implementing inclusive behaviors.  in addition, associates participated in de&i training which  was delivered in different formats, including e-learning as well as instructor-led trainings. ross curates the content, enabling us to support our specific de&i goals. we continue to expand our de&i education offerings to leaders and associates with additional learning resources. as part of our efforts to ensure we recruit and develop  diverse talent, we also provided specialized de&i experience-based training to all managers and above in human resources and created standardized tools and training to help mitigate potential unconscious bias in succession planning and talent calibration discussions.  we have integrated de&i training into the onboarding process  for all associates and participants in our internship program. on an annual basis, we provide training on ross’ code of business conduct and ethics for full-time associates and non-harassment training for all associates. to build on these efforts, we continue to offer on-demand learning resources and guided roundtable discussions about a variety of topics on our dedicated de&i portal for associates.  attracting and retaining diverse talent our talent acquisition teams continue to drive our efforts to recruit and retain associates from diverse backgrounds. all job postings include our de&i commitment statement, and we continue to search for opportunities to broaden our recruitment pipeline. we post jobs at all levels on a broad range of career sites, including sites focused on diverse job seekers. examples include handshake beyond pride as well as professional diversity network, which shares our roles across additional recruiting platforms. in  , we established or extended partnerships with  historically black colleges and universities (hbcus) and major national organizations including ascend, diversityinc., human rights campaign, mba veterans network, national black mba association, national organization on disability, nextup, prospanica, and seramount. these organizations not only help ross identify diverse talent to add to our ranks, but also provide information, content, and resources to assist in the development and advancement of our associates.  we also expanded our efforts to increase diversity in our  internship program and our early career positions by partnering with organizations such as the black retail action group, working with hbcus, and participating in several diversity-focused recruitment efforts with organizations such as the national retail federation and   the fashion scholarship fund. nextup advancing all  women in business      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethically empowering our associatesour commitment to diversity, equality, and inclusion continuing to build community networks in  , ross furthered its commitment to instilling  a sense of community and belonging among our associates. we expanded to six community networks, company-recognized groups of associates with common identities who come together for activities that support the company’s overarching de&i vision and objectives. the networks are being developed to include various dimensions of diversity, such as race, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, and military experience.  these groups help shape an even more inclusive  environment, enabling networking opportunities, enhancing professional development, and amplifying commemorative holidays and dates of significance. in  , the networks held more than   events, including a veteran’s day speaker panel hosted by the military community network (valor), a diwali celebration hosted by the inspirasian community network, a speaker series for national hispanic heritage month hosted by latinx connect, a black history month career panel hosted by the black/african american community (blaac) at ross, and an education session with pflag hosted by ross pride. we also support social justice efforts and invest in diverse  communities where we operate. in  , we made donations to several organizations working to advance de&i, which are further described in the “supporting our communities” chapter of this report.  recognizing diverse holidays and  commemorative events in  , ross highlighted a wide array of annual  commemorative events and holidays to recognize the diversity of our associates. these observances included black history month, women’s history month and international women’s day, national developmental disabilities month, asian pacific american heritage month, mental health awareness month, pride month, juneteenth, national hispanic heritage month, national native american heritage month, veterans day, and many others.  throughout the calendar year, observances are  commemorated with internal and external touchpoints, such as the distribution of historical facts, educational resources, and associate stories, as well as additional communications including videos, signage, and social media posts. community networks often host special events tied to these holidays and commemorative months such as seminars, discussions, networking events, and other engagements for associates. we also recognized the need for associates to have  dedicated time to honor the breadth of diverse holidays and events that they may observe individually. in  , we introduced diversity day, an additional paid day off for corporate and buying office associates. whether it is participating in a juneteenth celebration, a pride march, a religious observance, veterans day, or other holidays and events, eligible associates can choose to use their diversity day in a way that is personally meaningful. ross does a great job supporting  not only veterans but also their  families. the transition from  serving your country in the military  to stepping out into a civilian  career can be scary and difficult.  one of the things ross does really  well through their de&i efforts  is to support the conversation  about what a veteran and their  family can bring to the table and  how that can be leveraged.   —  ross associate and military

ethically operating sustainably    corporate social responsibility report  about environmental sustainability at ross overview sustainability is ingrained in ross’ culture. for decades,  we have worked hard to drive out waste and inefficiency from our operations, which, in turn, has reduced our impact on the environment. as our company grows and as part of our commitment to aligning our practices to our values, we recognize the need to advance our ambitions to help create a sustainable future for all, while also delivering value to our customers. in  , we continued our commitment to transparency  by participating in the cdp   climate change questionnaire, receiving a score of b on our disclosure.*  we also continue to pursue our target of reducing scope    &   greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions by   percent per square foot by   versus a   baseline; more information about our progress can be found in the climate and energy overview section of this report. we have organized our ghg emissions to align with the greenhouse gas protocol’s scope definitions. • scope   emissions are from sources that are owned or controlled by ross.  • scope   emissions are from the generation of energy and electricity purchased by ross.  • scope   emissions are from sources not owned or controlled by ross.   last year, we announced our ambition to reach net-zero ghg emissions by   or sooner. in support of that ambition, ross developed a target to reduce our absolute scope   and   emissions by  % by   against a   baseline. this target is consistent with the united nations’ paris agreement guidelines and aligns with an emissions pathway intended to limit global warming to  .  degrees celsius. we are continuing to explore strategies to achieve this ambition and target while also creating business value and we look forward to sharing our progress on ghg reduction as well as other aspects of our environmental sustainability efforts in our public disclosures, like the cdp questionnaire and future csr reports. our focus we understand that the health of our environment is directly linked to the health of our company. environmental sustainability is an important issue for all businesses to consider when conducting operations, and our sustainability strategy is informed by the specific nature of our operations.  we conducted an assessment to determine which  environmental sustainability issues are most important to our associates, stakeholders, and communities. we concluded that the most critical environmental areas of opportunity in our operations are ghg emissions, energy use, and waste. while water is not a significant area of impact for ross, we are aware of the importance of water conservation and have programs in place to be efficient in our water usage.  program oversight to ensure that our environmental sustainability strategy is aligned with our business strategy and has the adequate support and guidance to be successful, we have established robust program governance. at the top of our sustainability program governance is our board of directors. the audit committee of the board of directors assists the board with oversight of the sustainability program and climate risks, and  it receives regular reports on the company’s environmental sustainability efforts.  ross has also established the cross-functional environmental  sustainability steering committee (essc), comprised of senior leaders from across the company, including those from store operations, supply chain, property development, finance, indirect procurement, and legal teams. the essc is responsible for identifying and managing risks and opportunities associated with climate change, informing and endorsing ghg emissions and waste reduction strategies, and identifying and supporting projects in pursuit of achieving those strategies. additionally, the essc provides input to a dedicated sustainability team and aligns ross’ sustainability program with overall business strategy.  business unit leaders who implement and oversee energy  efficiency, energy management, and waste minimization efforts across the company are critical members of our sustainability program. our management provides regular updates to the audit committee regarding the company’s environmental and sustainability efforts and the status of our initiatives.  *cdp,

intended to limit global warming to  .  degrees celsius. in addition, in  , we explored ross’ carbon reduction pathways for emissions from our own operations as well as our indirect scope   emissions.  we continued our commitment to transparency by  submitting the cdp climate change questionnaire in  , receiving a b on our submission for the third consecutive year. we responded to cdp again in  , and our response includes our   ghg inventory, as well as detailed information about our climate-related risks, opportunities, strategies, and management. climate-related risks ross continues to assess the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. as a company that was founded and is headquartered in california, we are conscious of the threat posed by the increased prevalence of wildfires. in addition, we have stores and operations across the united states and in guam and are susceptible to extreme weather events that have been intensified by climate change, such as hurricanes and floods. these direct physical risks, along with other physical and transition risks impacting our direct operations and global supply chain, are likely to become more severe as the planet continues to warm.  to further our understanding of the future impacts of  climate change on our business, we are performing a tcfd-aligned climate-related scenario analysis. please see our   cdp response for additional details on our response to climate-related risks.  overview of ghg emissions  on an annual basis, ross completes a ghg accounting of our scope   and   impacts and a measurement of certain categories of our scope   impact. we are expanding our measurement capabilities to understand impacts associated with additional relevant scope   categories.  our   ghg inventory was assembled in accordance  with industry standards, including guidelines from the greenhouse gas protocol, the climate registry, and the u.s. environmental protection agency’s center for corporate climate leadership. our reported   ghg scope  ,  , and   emissions were also verified by a third party to assure accuracy and completeness.  ghg emissions are typically reported in terms of metric  tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mt co e). the intensity of our scope   and   emissions per square foot decreased approximately   percent between our ghg emissions target baseline year of

responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy details we endeavor to decrease our energy intensity year  over year, which reduces our environmental impact and associated costs. please see the table on page   for additional details on our multi-year energy usage.  in  , the electricity purchased to operate our facilities  represented   percent of our total energy consumption, as measured in megawatt hours (mwh) and gigajoules (gj). the great majority of that purchased electricity was used to operate our ross dress for less and dd’s discounts stores. energy efficiency because electricity consumption is such a large part of our energy usage and operational emissions, an important aspect of our ghg management strategy addresses electricity use in our buildings. our investments in lighting, insulation, heating, ventilation, air conditioning (hvac), and building energy management systems have enabled us to reduce electricity use. we have teams committed to finding new and better ways to achieve energy efficiency through improved processes and new technologies. we are also piloting energy audits at select locations to identify new opportunities to optimize energy use. since  , we have decreased the electricity per square foot required to power our stores, distribution facilities, and offices by over   percent. supporting electrical grid stability ross participates in demand response programs to help support local electrical grids. through these programs, we voluntarily reduce our energy usage during peak demand times to alleviate strain on the grid and help prevent blackouts or brownouts. we reduce our electricity usage by utilizing energy management systems that are integrated with our stores to adjust hvac systems. by doing so, we are helping keep the lights on for our customers and supporting the overall health and stability of the local electrical system. ross had nearly   stores participating in demand response programs in  , and we aim to expand our participation to more locations in  .renewable energy ross has solar panels installed on the roof of select stores. because a majority of our stores are leased, options to invest in on-site renewable energy generation are limited. we continue to evaluate opportunities and partnerships to pursue renewable energy in meaningful ways, including installing solar panels to generate electricity at our next distribution center and evaluating  other opportunites for on-site solar. total  electricity  usage by  location % stores   % offices  % distribution  facilities      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy efficiency  stores for many years, we have made investments to  decrease the amount of energy used by our climate control and lighting systems, which consume most of the electricity purchased to operate our stores.  technologies such as led lighting and high- efficiency hvac units have significantly decreased the electricity required to operate these systems. we had led lighting installed in nearly all of our stores, and led lighting will be installed in all of our new stores for the foreseeable future. additionally, we use high-efficiency hvac units whenever possible by retrofitting existing hvac equipment or by including them in new store builds.  to further reduce the energy required to operate  climate control and lighting systems, we utilize an advanced building energy management platform that enables more precise control over our energy management and shaves off unnecessary electricity use. this technology also allows us to quickly and easily adjust occupancy schedules, lighting levels, and temperatures across our stores, which provides operational benefits in addition to energy savings. this system also allows for remote diagnosis of hvac issues to quickly identify and correct inefficiencies, which can prevent unnecessary downtime and costly technician visits to our stores. we can also quickly respond to requests to lower our electricity usage to help electric utilities avoid rolling blackouts during critical periods like heat waves. through the use of this platform, we estimate that we have reduced energy usage at our stores by more than   million kilowatt-hours from when we began piloting in   through the end of  .  we also design our new stores with efficiency at the  center, understanding that investments in the earliest stage of store development pay off for years to come. in addition to including led lighting, high-efficiency hvac equipment, and advanced energy management systems, some of our locations use thicker, higher-quality insulation than is required by code and white roofs to deflect heat. these actions result in new stores that are more energy efficient, which lowers our energy usage, environmental impact, and costs. as we continue to add more stores over the long term, efficient new store design will be critical for mitigating our environmental impact. energy management  platform reduced usage  at stores by more than    million kilowatt- hours since        corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy efficiency  distribution centers ross’ distribution and warehouse facilities represent a  smaller portion of our electricity consumption and, on average, use less energy per square foot to operate than do our stores.  • we utilize an “air purging” program that uses natural air to cool our facilities. during the day, the sun heats up our buildings. at night when temperatures drop, we purge the hot air from the building and welcome in fresh, naturally cool air. this allows us to avoid several hours of air conditioning, saving energy costs. moreover, the purging program reduces our electricity demand during peak daytime hours and therefore reduces pressure on the electrical grid.  • we use highly efficient conveyor systems with variable frequency drives, sensors, and automation that shuts off equipment when not in demand. • we have led lighting and sensors that shut off lights when areas of a facility are not in use. many of our facilities also have skylights to take advantage of natural light.  • we use battery-powered forklifts and material-handling equipment to move merchandise within many of our distribution facilities. in general, this battery-operated equipment is more energy efficient and has a lower overall cost of ownership as compared to its fuel-powered counterparts.  • our new distribution centers are designed with energy efficiency in mind, with white roofs to reflect sunlight and advanced building energy management systems. our roofs are also “solar ready.”  • we are integrating solar electric power generation at a future distribution center.  • we performed energy audits at select distribution centers and identified additional opportunities to optimize energy use.  all of these approaches help our distribution centers reduce air pollution, limit ghg emissions, and achieve cost savings.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy efficiency  offices, employee  commuting, and travel our corporate headquarters in dublin, california, achieved leadership in  energy and environmental design (leed) gold certification from the u.s. green building council, with features that increase our associates’ comfort while minimizing our environmental impact. the sustainability features of our headquarters include energy management  equipment such as high-efficiency hvac equipment, energy star appliances, and lighting with motion sensors and daylight controls. additionally, we converted our interior and exterior lighting to leds.  we also enabled lower-emission transportation options by having on-site  electric vehicle charging stations, providing bicycle storage and changing facilities, and locating the campus close to public transportation. we also offer programs that help our associates to pay for public transportation using pre-tax dollars.  we support lower-carbon travel options for the field leadership organization,  which supports stores across the country. one of the key functions of our field leaders is to visit and provide direct guidance to stores in their area, which means many of these leaders spend a lot of time on the road. to help lower the ghg impact of these visits, ross has a corporate fleet of primarily hybrid vehicles. we estimate that we would have used over   percent more fuel in   if our fleet contained only conventional vehicles.       corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenergy efficiency  product transportation although ross does not own the trucks, trains, and ocean vessels that transport our  products, we know that the impact of transporting our products is a significant source of indirect emissions.  we work continuously with our transportation providers to improve shipping efficiency  across our distribution network as we grow our business and store base.  some of the strategies we deployed in   include: •  shipments were consolidated whenever possible to reduce the number of trips to  stores each day.  •  we shipped by rail whenever possible, which is less polluting than standard ground  transportation. approximately   percent of outbound freight from our distribution centers was shipped via rail in  .  •  approximately   percent of our transportation partners participated in the  smartway partnership, a u.s. environmental protection agency program that improves fuel efficiency and reduces air pollution.  •  the capacity of each trailer was maximized through floor loading and removing  unnecessary packaging, leading to fewer shipments.  •  we completed route optimization projects, which eliminate  .  million over-the- road miles from store deliveries on an annual basis. we have processes in place to continue reviewing opportunities to reduce miles and routes quarterly as we grow.  •  we utilized electric yard vehicles at select distribution centers to replace vehicles  with internal combustion engines.  •  we worked with international transportation partners on optimal loading of containers  shipped on ocean vessels. this lowered the number of containers needed to ship our products from overseas, reducing the total number of shipments and emissions.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablywaste management and recycling overview  the waste we generate is one of our company’s most  material impacts, and we work hard to manage and reduce our waste footprint.  we have waste diversion programs in our stores,  distribution centers, and corporate and buying offices, and we encourage our associates to participate in practices that increase our recycling, reduce waste, and decrease our use of natural resources. much of the operational waste we produce at our stores and distribution centers is from the packaging in which our merchandise is shipped. because of our off-price business model, a lot of our merchandise is produced to other retailers’ specifications. we often do not have control over the types of packaging on our products, so we focus on developing and executing programs to reuse and recycle the packaging we receive.  waste diversion from landfill we measure the percentage of our waste that we divert from landfill across our retail operations. this measurement includes all stores and ross-controlled distribution centers and warehouses. in  , our estimated landfill diversion remained approximately   percent.* waste   diversion  %   *this figure is approximate. we expect the accuracy of our waste measurements to improve over time.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyminimizing waste  stores approximately two-thirds of our operational waste is  generated in our stores; a significant portion of that waste is cardboard.  because they represent such a large percentage of our  waste footprint, cardboard boxes are an important part of our effort to reduce our waste and demonstrate our commitment to being a responsible retailer.  a majority of our stores participate in a cardboard  recycling program in which used boxes are backhauled to a regional facility, baled, and delivered to a recycling partner. this effort to recycle quickly adds up. across participating stores in  , we recycled over  ,  tons of cardboard through the backhaul recycling program, and we are investigating opportunities to expand this program to more stores.  in addition, we work with our local waste and recycling  partners and with landlords to make cardboard recycling receptacles available whenever possible in locations where we are unable to backhaul. other recycling and waste reduction  programs in our stores include: • reusable bags: we sell branded reusable  shopping bags at our stores.  • shopping bags with recycled content: all the plastic and paper shopping bags we provide to customers contain recycled material.  • reusable hangers: we avoid single-use hangers when possible and have a reuse program for store hangers.  • dumpster rightsizing: we continuously adjust the number of trash dumpsters and enhance collection schedules to help stores optimize their recycling rates.  • service automation: we are implementing technology that ensures trash compactors are only serviced when full, reducing unnecessary pickups and hauling expenses.  • digital resources: to reduce paper waste, many of our reports, trainings, policies, and other resources are available digitally.  • other diversion programs: in certain geographies, we have pursued other diversion efforts, such as organic waste programs and single-stream recycling. we also have programs to manage regulated and electronic waste.       corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyminimizing waste  distribution centers our distribution centers receive merchandise  from many countries. we process and ship these goods to stores across the country, typically in cardboard boxes.  we use a packing and shipping system that  minimizes the number of boxes and trucks required to deliver merchandise, as well as a system to recycle the millions of boxes we receive each year. as a result, we recycled over  ,  tons of material generated in our distribution centers in  .  we continuously look for ways to optimize  how products are packaged for shipping, which includes working upstream with our suppliers and within our facilities to minimize unnecessary packaging materials when possible. we also reuse the cardboard boxes in which we receive merchandise from our suppliers when possible.  we test new recycling systems at our  distribution centers and stores, including ongoing efforts to recycle plastic film and scrap metal. in addition, we are piloting a program to recycle tires from our forklifts and other material handling equipment. these efforts divert tons of waste from  landfill. as an added benefit, they also help us reduce waste disposal costs.  in  , to help us divert waste from landfill  while also supporting the communities we serve, we continued programs to donate unsellable merchandise to local nonprofits.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyminimizing waste  offices small changes in how we operate our offices also have a positive impact  on the planet.  examples of initiatives we had in place in  : • we continued to adapt our internal collaboration and reporting processes to use digital tools instead of paper. one such change to our printing process initiated in   is expected to eliminate more than   tons of paper use annually.  • generally, when we do print, we try to minimize environmental impact by using paper that has postconsumer content; setting printers to print double-sided; and using large-capacity, refurbished toner cartridges that result in less plastic, steel, aluminum, and rubber waste as compared to traditional toners. we also have a program to recycle office paper.  • in the café at our corporate office, we provide flatware and utensils that are reusable or compostable, and we encourage the use of reusable plates as well. we also supply deskside recycling bins and provide convenient organic waste and single-stream recycling receptacles in common areas.  • the majority of our associates receive electronic paychecks, which reduces paper use.  • hydration stations are available to reduce single-use plastic bottle waste.  • an e-waste recycling program handles damaged or obsolete electronic equipment. • at our buying offices, we have programs to repurpose fabric scraps and donate product samples to local charities when possible.       corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities conducting business ethically operating sustainablyenvironmental sustainability in the supply chain  much of the apparel, footwear, accessories, and home- related merchandise sold in our stores is purchased from suppliers after they have been produced to other retailers’ specifications. this creates a challenge when we try to influence our upstream scope   emissions. however, in support of our ambition to reach net-zero ghg emissions by   or sooner, we are continuing to examine scope   emissions that occur in our supply chain.  in terms of environmental compliance in our supply  chain, we require that vendors sell us only products that comply with applicable laws, including those related to environmental protection and product safety; we will not knowingly purchase products made in violation of established environmental or consumer product safety requirements.  additionally, we maintain a large supply chain with a  broad network of suppliers to give us flexibility in the event that any of our individual suppliers are impaired by climate-related issues.  additional details are available in the “conducting  business ethically” chapter of this report.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethically conducting business ethically     corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyintroduction  ethical business practices are critically  important to ross and can be seen in the way we treat our constituents— from customers and associates to vendors and investors.  we are dedicated to operating with high standards of  integrity and transparency, and adhering to policies and processes designed and implemented to drive towards meeting these standards.  ross’ corporate governance practices and policies have  been developed with those high standards in mind. these policies highlight the company’s governing principles and expectations regarding business ethics for ross executives, associates, and business partners.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyour approach to sourcing and human rights our commitment to corporate social  responsibility extends to our supply chain and the vendors we work with throughout the world.  ross supports responsible business practices and  human rights throughout our supply chain. vendors, manufacturers, and other company business partners are required to comply with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws relating to the manufacture and production of products sold to ross, including laws relating to:  • labor compensation;  • working conditions; • child, slave, prison, or forced labor;  • environmental protection; • product safety;  • corruption or bribery (including foreign  corrupt practices);  • building and working safety conditions; and  • similar obligations.  to the extent contractors or subcontractors are involved in the production of goods supplied to ross, vendors must require that these parties are similarly compliant with ross’ vendor code of conduct.  ross’ standards and requirements related to sourcing  and human rights are incorporated in various company documents, including ross’ code of business conduct and ethics, vendor compliance manual, purchase orders, vendor compliance and indemnity agreements, and buying agent agreements. ross’ standards and requirements related to human rights are also designed to comport with applicable universal declaration of human rights (udhr) and international labor organization (ilo) standards. for more information, refer to our vendor compliance manual and our code of business conduct and ethics, which are located on our partners website and in the corporate governance   section of our website, respectively.  we closely monitor evolving issues throughout the world  to promote adherence by our suppliers and business partners to our policies and commitments, as well as to federal, state, and local laws. ross will not knowingly purchase products manufactured using child, slave, prison, or forced labor, or where workers are not provided wages or safe working environments as required by law. additionally, we will not knowingly purchase products made in violation of established environmental or consumer product safety requirements.  if we become aware of a vendor's non-compliance  with ross' requirements or procedures, including any applicable local, national, or international labor or human trafficking laws, we will take appropriate responsive action, which can include suspending the vendor's shipments and/or terminating the business relationship.       corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyresponsible sourcing  beyond communicating our standards and requirements  related to sourcing and human rights in various company documents, ross dedicates significant resources and drives processes to promote responsible sourcing.  the majority of the apparel, footwear, accessories, and  home-related products sold in our stores are purchased from suppliers after they have been produced to other retailers’ specifications. though ross does not have direct control over the manufacturing processes for these products, we require suppliers to uphold our ethical standards. some products are ordered and imported directly through  international buying agents or certain overseas vendors. for these items, we have additional processes and requirements in place to monitor and enforce compliance.  to start, we communicate our standards and requirements,  and provide training to vendors, buyers, and overseas buying agents during our purchasing processes. we provide initial training to new associates, as well as ongoing training and updates to buyers and other associates involved in our product sourcing. further, we regularly monitor and assess our supply chain for compliance related to product safety, labor laws, and human-trafficking concerns.  in addition, we maintain a social compliance program  intended to promote compliance with our vendor code of conduct, which requires adherence to local labor, safety, and environmental laws. the program employs numerous resources, including inspections conducted by buying agents and audits conducted by leading third-party auditors. those resources not only proactively engage and advise vendors on maintaining compliant sourcing practices, but also, where appropriate, are utilized to encourage remediation and corrective actions. in  , over  ,  supplier inspections and audits were  conducted under the social compliance program. during their reviews. ross’ third-party auditors or buying agent  teams directly conducted or reviewed inspections or audits from accredited sources. additionally, members of our internal compliance team supervised buying agents and third-party auditors as they conducted select inspections and audits in multiple countries. ross-directed third-party audits and buying agent  inspections require a physical review of manufacturing factories, a review of factory records and certifications, plus interviews with factory workers. ross compliance associates review reports from these audits and inspections, and, when relevant, track corrective action.where we become aware that a vendor or its manufacturing factory is out of compliance, we take appropriate responsive action, which can include suspending all merchandise shipments from the offending vendor and/or terminating the business relationship. on an on-going basis, ross monitors and addresses  emerging compliance concerns through our partnerships with industry trade associations (e.g., american apparel & footwear association, national retail federation, and retail industry leaders association), and our consultations with our legal counsels and international trade experts. we continue to enhance our compliance approach consistent with evolving risk and industry standards. supplier diversity we care about sourcing goods and services from a diverse set of suppliers. through our participation and membership in organizations such as the national minority supplier development council (nmsdc), the women’s business enterprise national council (wbenc), and the national lgbt chamber of commerce, we show our support for diverse supplier communities.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyproduct safety ross is committed to the sale of safe  products in our stores. through various vendor-facing documents (e.g., purchase  order, vendor compliance manual, and indemnification agreement), we require our vendors to provide products that comply with applicable federal, state, and local statutes, rules, and regulations. additionally, we reference relevant legislation and  safety standards when designing our buying and selling strategies. although ross does not buy or sell hazardous chemicals, we recognize that some consumer products may contain natural components and synthetic chemicals as ingredients. to protect the safety of our customers, we require that vendors’ products comply with the federal hazardous substances act and any corresponding state laws. these laws mandate proper labeling, warning requirements, and product testing.  children’s products are subject to rigorous requirements,  including the consumer product safety improvement act (cpsia). compliance with the cpsia is strictly enforced by the consumer product safety commission (cpsc). ross requires that vendors of cpsia-impacted products confirm that they meet the cpsc’s requirements.  where ross sources food and cosmetic products  overseas, we require that suppliers submit labeling and ingredients for compliance review and abide by all applicable u.s. food and drug administration (fda) requirements. additionally, we review and confirm that foreign food suppliers meet food safety modernization act (fsma) requirements and corresponding fda regulations.  ross maintains a product recall program that includes  continuous monitoring of customer claims, store incidents, and government recalls. where appropriate, we conduct internal reviews to verify that we follow relevant government/supplier instructions for removal and/or destruction. similarly, as needed, we initiate a product recall for applicable products that fail to meet our safety standards.  in support of our product safety commitment, we require that our vendors comply with our vendor compliance manual. the vendor compliance manual provides an overview of the various requirements applicable to the products we sell and references sources of additional information. a copy of our vendor compliance manual is available at  our partners website.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallyevolving issues standards and regulations regarding consumer products and  supply chains are continually changing. ross requires that all of our vendors engage in responsible business practices and uphold human rights throughout our supply chain.  as part of our obligations under section   of the   dodd-frank wall street reform and consumer protection act, we conduct an annual investigation where we review and disclose the existence of conflict minerals (specifically tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold) in products we sell. we require suppliers to identify the source of conflict minerals incorporated in or consumed by the manufacturing of products they provide. as necessary, we perform due diligence regarding the source of those minerals. ross’ conflict minerals disclosure is available in the investors section of our website.  we do not specifically seek apparel or other merchandise  containing animal fur. given our opportunistic buying of already manufactured products, products we sell may occasionally contain incidental fur.  ross’ code of conduct specifically prohibits the use of  involuntary or forced labor by vendors and their contractors anywhere in their manufacturing or supply chain. we have zero tolerance for such violations and have taken additional, enhanced efforts to prevent forced labor in our supply chain. this process includes, but is not limited to, vendor communications, vendor monitoring, and factory audits and inspections. we are aware of concerns regarding involuntary or forced labor in the global supply chain, and our program is designed to monitor, address, and take the appropriate corrective action where necessary.      corporate social responsibility report  | ross stores, inc. empowering our associates supporting our communities operating sustainably conducting business ethicallygovernance and
