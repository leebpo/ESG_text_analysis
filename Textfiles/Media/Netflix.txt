climate change sustainably. it’s why netflix has committed to halving our  emissions by  . we will do this by optimizing our energy use, then  electrifying it and decarbonizing the rest.  second , inclusion:  netflix is becoming more representative of the  members we serve. we now have offices in over   countries. almost half  of our employees are women and, in the us,  % are from historically  excluded ethnic and/or racial backgrounds. we’re also seeing increased  representation on and off screen — with significantly more female directors  and showrunners, and more people of color in leading roles.  third , governance: our business model is well proven and netflix is a  leader in streaming entertainment in terms of engagement, revenue and  profit. so we’re evolving to a more standard large-cap governance  structure, including the phased declassification of our board, the  elimination of supermajority voting provisions and changes to our  executive compensation program from   onwards. over the last   years, we’ve worked hard to create long term value for our  stakeholders — in particular members, shareholders and the creative  community. while we’ve made good progress, there’s still more to do. for  example, most of our carbon emissions come from our productions, which  require a lot of power — often in remote locations — and are still heavily  fossil fuel dependent. but we’re investing in the technology innovations  today that can optimize and electrify this energy use tomorrow.  we are excited about the great entertainment coming this year — from  returning favorites like our emmy award winning series the crown   and recently released hit action sequel extraction   , starring chris  hemsworth, to must-watch new films and tv shows such as heart of  stone , rebel moon , griselda  and   body problem . our north stars remain  the variety and quality of our entertainment — and, as always, we welcome  your feedback.  ted sarandos  co-chief

by   ; and     bring our remaining net emissions from   onwards to zero , in  support of global net zero goals, by investing in nature-based solutions  that retain and capture carbon . when we first set our emissions targets, we aligned to the science  based targets initiative (sbti) standard for scope   “supplier  engagement” targets . after working to improve our scope   data,  we submitted an upgraded quantitative “intensity” target  aligned to  current sbti standards for validation in  . the new target, which  has now been approved by the sbti, is to reduce scope   emissions   % per

are   delighted to see netflix apply the same positive disruption   to sustainability that they’ve applied to their business, upping   the ambition for achieving near-term net zero targets and   harnessing the power of storytelling to educate and   entertain citizens.  christiana figueres,  diplomat and architect of the u.n. paris agreement  the carbon trust, a respected think tank, found these iso net  zero guidelines to be the most comprehensively aligned  to to the  goals of cop  .   including participants from the greenhouse gas protocol, sbti, un framework convention on climate change,  and un race to zero teams.    we are working with iso to ensure understanding this element of their guidelines because of the limited volume of  high quality carbon removal credits available today, and the ipcc’s latest report  shows that the mitigation options  with the greatest potential global contribution to net emission reduction by   are “avoidance” projects.    the iso net zero guidelines define residual emissions as: emissions that remain on an annual basis after all efforts  to reduce along a  .  °c pathway within value-chain or boundary emissions have been implemented. sustainability strategy sustainability in our operations and value chain netting remaining emissions to zero sustainability in storytelling   climate risk environment governance social introduction appendix    netflix esg report    to meet these objectives we are focused on four key levers :climate transition plan  energy efficiency : identifying cost-effective efficiency  improvements for energy used in our offices and studios;  vehicle electrification : transitioning from vehicles that use fossil  fuels to fully electric and/or hydrogen powered alternatives;  clean mobile power : using alternatives to diesel generators on  productions; and  renewable energy : using renewable electricity and fuels. we approach these four levers using an oed framework — i.e., first  optimizing energy use, then electrifying it and decarbonizing the rest.  ● optimize (o) : we are conducting energy efficiency audits,  including for our stages, studios and offices, so we can optimize  vehicle fleet operations, right-size vehicles and mobile power  and give preference to more efficient equipment.  ● electrify (e): we are working to electrify the equipment that  uses the most fuel, like vehicles, buildings and generators.  where available, we use electric motors, which are more  efficient and because electricity is more easily decarbonized.  we’ve successfully piloted the use of mobile batteries and  hydrogen-battery powered generators in lieu of fossil-fuel  powered generators in our productions. and we are also  replacing fossil-fuel vehicles with electric, plug-in hybrid and  hybrid vehicles.  ● decarbonize (d) : when optimization and electrification aren’t  possible, we decarbonize the remaining emissions by installing  and purchasing renewable energy. this means matching  renewable electricity to any grid-connected power that isn’t  carbon-free and shifting to lower-carbon or zero-carbon fuel  options when that isn’t possible. last year, we procured  renewable electricity to match our global electricity demand and  we’re exploring more direct investments.  sustainability strategy sustainability in our operations and value chain netting remaining

maximizing the solutions available today, while accelerating the  market for tomorrow’s solutions, is also imperative.  while energy  efficiency and renewable energy solutions are cost-effective and  can be deployed at scale now, clean mobile power and evs are  more nascent technologies. as a result they will deliver most of  their respective emissions reductions for netflix in the latter half of this decade. refer to the energy efficiency, renewable energy  and clean mobile power sections below. each year, we continually  develop and further refine our   science-based target  transition

mobile batteries,  battery-hybrid generators, and hydrogen power  units, resulting in fuel reductions that lowered  emissions by  ,  mtco e . this included the  deployment of over   pieces of clean mobile  power equipment and battery-hybrid generators  deployed for the first time. netflix also expanded  the geographic reach of these solutions, deploying  solutions in and around atlanta, austin, dublin,  lisbon, london, los angeles, new york, paris,  toronto and vancouver. here are a few examples of  clean mobile power in our   productions. clean mobile power  batteries: virgin river season   built on their experience from season   to  expand their use of batteries to power set and ancillary power needs,  reducing the season’s diesel generator fuel use by  %. the union , filmed  around

everyone — and because we believe  collective actions will yield positive outcomes, faster.  we do this through:  industry collaboration sustainable production industry groups :  netflix is a member of several industry groups globally (e.g., sustainable   production alliance  (global), bafta’s albert  (uk and global), reel  green/on tourne vert/ontario green screen (canada), green motion  (germany), sustainable screens australia, etc.) to help bring  transparency (e.g., close up: carbon emissions of film & television   production ) and public advocacy for sector transformation (e.g.,

 identify and deliver cost-competitive zero emissions mobile power at scale  for the entertainment industry. the long term goal is to eliminate diesel  generators in top production markets.  sustainable aviation buyers alliance :  making a film or series requires air travel. to accelerate progress towards  lowering the greenhouse gas emissions associated with burning jet fuel,  netflix co-founded the sustainable aviation buyers alliance (saba) .  saba sends market signals to producers of sustainable aviation fuel  (saf) to grow supply, facilitates coordinated procurement activity, and  ensures the environmental integrity of their claims. we also actively partner with other key business and non  profit consortia to: ( ) further our understanding of climate  representation on

empowering people to easily choose and experience films,  series and games they love is critical to a member’s joy every  time they go to netflix. we design our products to protect the  privacy and security of our members, and to be inclusive and  accessible to everyone. privacy  our service has always been subscription-based, and when   members sign up for any plan, we ask for very little information:   email, name and method of payment. our personal information   handling principles ensure our engineering and business teams   are aligned on our approach to privacy. our privacy statement   provides a detailed explanation of our privacy practices to our   members, including: the information netflix collects or receives   from each member; information from our partners; how we use and   disclose it (including advertising that we conduct off netflix to   promote our service); and the controls each member has in  relation   to this information.   in november of  , netflix introduced an ad-supported plan  which allows members to enjoy our service at a lower price with  limited ads. for those signing up for our ad-supported plan, we   also ask for date of birth and gender. members have the ability to   opt-out of the selection of ads based on third party behavioral   advertising (i.e., ads selected based on use and/or interactions   with unaffiliated third party websites and apps over time). we offer   members the ability to exercise such opt-outs through a simple   in-service control — and we do not share what individual members   watch with advertisers.

reach audiences all around the  world. however, our catalog varies from country to country,  including for rights reasons (i.e., we don’t have the rights to every  title in every country where we operate). in a few cases, we’ve  had to remove specific titles or episodes of titles in specific  countries to comply with government demands. below are the  titles we removed in   — three  in total. we report these  takedowns annually. information and cybersecurity  we strive to protect sensitive information through various means,  including: technical safeguards; procedural requirements and  policies; a program of monitoring to detect and address  unauthorized modification or misuse; continuous testing of  aspects of our security internally and with outside experts; and a  robust incident response program.  we regularly assess what areas of vulnerability there are, how we  detect issues, how we respond and then how we let people know.  we also have a  responsible vulnerability disclosure  program,  launched in  , that allows security researchers around the  world to find and report security vulnerabilities in netflix products  and systems in exchange for compensation.  the vice president (vp) of security, privacy, assurance and  corporate engineering oversees a team of employees dedicated to  information security. cybersecurity is discussed at every audit  committee meeting and is also a board-level issue. our vp  regularly attends audit committee meetings and provides updates  on cybersecurity matters. ●in august  , we complied with a written demand from the

that accessibility is just as important as the aesthetics,  speed and stability of our service.  making our service more accessible  we have designed features  like assistive listening systems,  brightness controls, keyboard shortcuts, screen readers, larger font  size and voice commands into our products. we also conduct  research with current and prospective members aimed at  identifying barriers to perceiving, navigating, and interacting with  netflix, and design solutions to remove those barriers. we take  advantage of device-specific assistive technologies (e.g., native  features on apple ios and android platforms) as much as possible.  we also create our own accessibility options, such as the ability to  change the font, size, shadow, and background color of closed  captions and subtitles on tv, and adjust playback speed on mobile.  our catalog of titles with subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing  (sdh), and audio descriptions (ad) for our members with vision  needs is continually expanding. all netflix-owned films and series  support sdh for the language in which they were originally  produced. we have also started expanding sdh and ad to nearly    languages , including spanish, portuguese, and french. netflix  members can browse titles with english audio descriptions in the  gallery on our website, and by selecting “audio description” under  the categories menu in our mobile apps. we also introduced new  badge icons for our shows and films that have ad and sdh on  web, tv, ios and android so members can more easily discover  stories suited to their needs, eliminating the inconvenient need to  play a title first.  we partner with vendors across the globe who are dedicated to  working with the blind and low vision community in many different  capacities, from hiring blind or low vision narrators, quality  controllers and co-author/editors to working with the community  and local organizations to gather feedback through focus groups.  guidelines for the creation of ad, timed text style guides, gaming  accessibility and minimizing photosensitivity issues – flashes or  patterns that could cause ill-effects in our audiences, are also

meeting, the netflix  board proposed and stockholders approved significant changes to  our corporate governance structure. we implemented a phased-in  declassification of our board, with directors elected at this year’s  annual meeting serving one-year terms and the entire board  standing for annual elections beginning in   and beyond. we  also eliminated supermajority voting provisions in our amended  and restated articles of incorporation (the “charter”) and our  amended and restated bylaws (the “bylaws”), provided  shareholders with the ability to call special meetings, and adopted  a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections. we  also adopted a market standard director resignation policy. here is  a summary of our corporate governance best practices and  stockholder rights: one share, one vote:  we have a single class of shares with each  share entitled to one vote.  majority voting standard : we have a majority voting standard in  uncontested director elections. any incumbent director who fails to  receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election must tender  their resignation to the board. the nominating and governance  committee would then make a recommendation to the board about  whether to accept or reject the resignation or take other action.  annual director elections (fully declassified by  ) : we have

ghg inventory methodology carbon credit project screening criteria  environment governance social introduction appendix    netflix esg report   greenhouse gas emissions (ghg)  inventory methodology  netflix reports its emissions following the world resources institute (wri) /  world business council for sustainable development’s (wbcsd) greenhouse  gas protocol corporate standard, as amended by the ghg protocol scope    guidance, as well as wri / wbcsd’s greenhouse gas protocol corporate  value chain (scope  ) accounting and reporting standard and technical  guidance for calculating scope   emissions (collectively, the ghg protocol).  netflix ghg emissions reporting follows the operational control approach set  out by the ghgp.  our reported emissions account for all ghgs covered by the unfccc kyoto   protocol (annex a)  relevant to netflix activities and are converted into metric  tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtco e) as specified by the ghg  protocol. all emission factors are applied to the data and updated annually  to reflect the latest guidance and factors published by us epa emission  factors for greenhouse gas inventories ( ), us epa egrid   electricity grid emission factors ( ) and uk defra greenhouse gas  reporting conversion factors ( ). additionally, where data is not available  or of sufficient quality, netflix uses proxy data, industry-average figures, or  expert assumptions. in such instances, we use third-party  sources for reliability and completeness.  some of these data sets such as the average building energy use intensity  values from the doe commercial building energy consumption survey  ( ), are held constant to maintain consistency across years.   netflix’s greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions reporting is consistent with the  “operational control” approach as set out by the ghg protocol corporate  accounting and reporting standard: revised edition. the organizational  and operational boundary applies to the global company including its  subsidiaries, the office and studio facilities we own and operate (e.g.,  albuquerque studios) as well as facilities we lease from others but over  which we have meaningful operational control (e.g., corporate and studio  offices and stages).  our footprint boundary  scope   and  : our emissions include all scope   (direct) and scope    (indirect emissions) from the following: our corporate operations (offices,  etc); the production of our films, series and games; and the storage and  delivery of our content. scope   emissions are calculated using  market-based and location-based emissions accounting methods defined  by the ghg protocol scope   guidance. location-based estimates  are calculated based on the emissions intensity of the locations where the  electricity consumption occurs. the market-based method incorporates  electricity procurement decisions that are chosen within the local electricity  market, including zero-carbon electricity supply from utilities (i.e., opt-in  “green tariff” rates) and contractual instruments such as renewable energy  certificates (recs).  about this report esg data tables sasb index tcfd index resources ghg inventory methodology carbon credit project screening criteria  environment governance social introduction appendix    netflix esg report   we also use a target-based emissions accounting method relative to our  science=based targets, which is custom to netflix. target-based emissions  incorporate direct renewable energy supply (e.g., onsite generation, utility &  landlord supply, power purchase agreements or direct investments) but do  not account for emissions from contractual instruments such as renewable  energy certificates (recs).  scope  : netflix also estimates and reports relevant scope   categories,  which therefore includes activities outside of our operational control.  our  scope   boundary was established in alignment with the ghg protocol  corporate and scope   standards. netflix includes all relevant and material  sources of emissions including categories  - ,  -  and  . in the future, we  aim to include category   (emissions related to waste in operations) by  improving our direct data collection. for now, most estimated waste-related  emissions in our footprint are captured in category   (purchased goods &  services) using spend-based estimates on facilities management and  production operations.  scope   emissions use location-based emissions factors except where  individual suppliers provided supplier specific emissions that are  market-based (e.g., aws) or through application of recs to scope    emissions where information on the specific energy consumption by location  was available (e.g., for the open connect network) in order to match the  contractual instrument to known energy consumption in accordance with  ghg protocol scope   guidance. netflix works with individual suppliers,  wherever possible, to determine that any renewable contractual instruments  applied to their emissions are appropriately attributed.  we include all netflix-branded content productions, whether we manage the  production directly (like the sea beast, spirit rangers, don’t look up, our  great national parks ), or through a third-party production company (like  glass onion: a knives out mystery, the elephant whisperers ) as well as all  content that we license that is netflix-branded (like octonauts: above and  beyond, captain nova, down to earth with zac efron ). activities outside of  our operational control present challenges to measuring and reducing  emissions, but because so much of production infrastructure, crew and  equipment are shared across studios, we believe that holding ourselves  accountable for all emissions from netflix-branded content (wherever it is  produced) will create a positive ripple effect across our own emissions as  well as the entire industry.  data management  we maintain a greenhouse gas inventory management plan to ensure  consistency of calculating and estimating emissions from year to year, and to  provide to our  rd party assurance providers as a basis for their audit of our  emissions. we maintain documentation as evidence to support our emissions  inventory and follow netflix retention policies for these records. in  , we  began implementing a carbon accounting software solution to help  streamline and mature our data collection processes, and to help maintain  related documentation. about this report esg data tables sasb index tcfd index resources ghg inventory

selection  our competitive requests for proposals (rfps) are issued widely, to over    project developers, non-profits, brokers and credit retailers across  many project types and geographies.  screen  : deep project- level diligence and impact screening  our team then conducts due diligence on the projects and holds live  interviews directly with the project developers and/or trusted project  partners. this includes research on the projects, their proponents and other  local stakeholders. engaging directly with the project hosts enables a screen  : meet core quality criteria  any credits that we purchase must meet globally recognized core quality  criteria: they must be additional, verified, based on a realistic baseline, not  double counted and issued by a credible standard that has robust  provisions in place to address permanence (the risk of reversal) and  leakage (the risk of displacing emissions from one location to another).  we only purchase credits that have been third-party verified and  registered on a trusted registry, including – verra, gold standard, climate  action reserve and american carbon registry – or have demonstrated an  equivalent level of rigor. deeper understanding of the unique circumstances and conditions that  surround a particular carbon credit project and how and why it came to be.  we also conduct additional screens for: local community ownership and  direct benefit sharing; job creation and training; women and girls  empowerment; biodiversity and habitat restoration and protection (e.g.,  verra climate, community & biodiversity certified projects); and climate  resilience impacts.  screen  : use digital tools and resources to improve visibility  where feasible, we use technology to enhance project validation and  verification, such as ai-powered satellite imagery, machine learning and  remote sensing analysis.  screen  : seek additional expert advice  netflix relies on its expert advisory group to provide additional insight and  guidance on an ongoing basis across a range of key issues, including our  carbon credit portfolio. this helps us identify things we may have missed. about this report esg data
