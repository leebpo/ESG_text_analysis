relationship with our viewers, employees and  stakeholders that provides us with opportunities to  positively affect our communities. our commitment to corporate social responsibility has continued to grow in the three years since the company was established through the expansion of fox forward, our company-wide philanthropic initiative. this year, our fox forward initiatives were focused  on three pillars: serving veterans and active-duty military members, enhancing educational  opportunities for underserved students and  investing in our local communities through our  partnerships, financial donations, volunteer efforts and magnification across our media assets. the power of fox forward and the fox brand was  perhaps best exemplified by our efforts to support the american red cross’ humanitarian aid efforts in ukraine earlier this year. we kicked off our   fundraising campaign with a $  million corporate gift to the red cross, but it was soon matched by more than tenfold. in just two weeks, over $  million was  raised by our employees and our viewers through a  giving campaign that ran across every fox platform, in daytime, primetime and online. the passion and generosity of our extended fox family was truly overwhelming, and the money raised represented nearly a third of the funds donated to the red cross’ humanitarian effort in the region. while fox forward’s mission is to positively   impact the lives of the people and the communities it serves, it also benefits our employees and various stakeholders. our team members report being  gratified by our community engagement and actively volunteer their own time and resources in support  of this unifying work. further, the impact we make  through fox forward deepens our viewers’  appreciation of our brands.in addition to showcasing our fox forward   initiatives for the last year, this report will highlight fox’s forward-thinking efforts in sustainability, employee benefits and resources, data security   and more. in thinking holistically about our   stakeholders, our strategic business objectives   and our capacity for driving measurable impact,   we are able to focus our resources to make   meaningful advances in these key areas. we will continue to do our part as a citizen of   the global community and to move fox forward  together. lachlan murdoch  executive chair and ceo, fox

exceed the international labour organization’s (ilo) conventions for eliminating discrimination in respect to employment and occupation. our commitment to creating and maintaining an  environment free of discrimination and harassment begins at the highest leadership level of the company and is embedded throughout our policies and practices. the fox standards of business conduct and the preventing harassment, discrimination and retaliation  policy, which are posted on our website, lay out our  framework for addressing complaints and taking remedial measures as needed. our standards of business conduct expressly state that  fox endeavors to ensure that the workplace “is free of bullying and harassment, whether the harassment  is sexual in nature, or is based on any characteristic  protected by applicable law.” it makes clear that it is our policy to “investigate promptly and thoroughly any complaint of discrimination or harassment and to take remedial measures if fox determines that there has been a violation of fox’s policy against such conduct.” we are also committed to maintaining a workplace that  treats all employees with dignity and respect, and is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination and retaliation. our preventing harassment, discrimination and retaliation policy protects individuals on the basis of a person’s actual or perceived race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, age, physical  disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, family status, caregiver  status, sex (including pregnancy status, childbirth, breastfeeding, and related medical conditions), gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, sexual and reproductive health decisions, reproductive  health decision-making, hair texture or hairstyles,  military or veteran status, political affiliation, arrest or conviction record, union membership, unemployment status, credit history, status as a victim of domestic violence, stalking or sexual offenses, or any other legally protected characteristic. any employee or applicant who believes they have  experienced or witnessed harassment, discrimination or retaliation, including as a bystander, must immediately report it to a manager in the company’s human resources department or to one of several alternative reporting channels, including the confidential, third-party managed alertline, which allows for anonymous  reporting of concerns. members of management who  learn of harassing, discriminatory or retaliatory conduct from any source are required to report it immediately. reported concerns are investigated, and if fox  determines that a violation of this policy has occurred, we take appropriate remedial action. these reports  and investigations are evaluated by the most senior  members of fox’s management team. the chief legal and policy officer must approve any settlement related to a violation of the fox standards of business conduct as well as claims related to sexual harassment or other forms of discrimination. further, the audit committee of the board of directors is informed of all matters that  require the chief legal and policy officer’s approval.the board has also adopted a clawback policy, whereby  the compensation committee has sole discretion to require reimbursement of all or any portion of any performance-based compensation or discretionary bonus paid to any executive for the period when the  executive engaged in harassment, discrimination and/or  retaliation, including the failure to respond to allegations or complaints of such behaviors. all new hires must complete training on the preventing harassment, discrimination and retaliation policy, as well as compliance and business ethics, and existing employees must complete the training periodically. freedom of association  fox has always been and will continue to be unequivocally committed to our employees and their right to freely associate with any third party. indeed, our preventing harassment, discrimination and retaliation policy forbids discrimination on the basis of political  affiliation or union membership. we firmly adhere to the  national labor relations act (nlra). the nlra and  the subsequent taft-hartley amendments protect rights of employees and employers in the private sector.  the foundation of the nlra includes the employees’ right to participate in protected, concerted activities,  to discuss working conditions openly and to choose to   be or not be associated and/or represented by a   third-party representative without fear of discrimination or retaliation. across fox entertainment, fox sports, fox television stations and the fox studio lot,  we are a party to

include information about how ethics concerns can be raised. employees can approach a   manager in human resources or an attorney in the   legal department, in any fox business unit. the chief ethics and compliance officer and designated  compliance or legal liaison in each respective business unit are also available to serve as additional resources. any stakeholder (including employees, suppliers,   customers and other third parties) can also use fox’s independently managed alertline. alertline supports anonymous reporting of concerns either through a  dedicated, domestic/international toll-free telephone number available   hours a day,   days a year, or through a secure website. translation services are available through alertline.  reports are treated confidentially. alertline (both online and telephonic) is maintained by a third-party provider.  the system generates an auditable log of all concerns that are received through that system. a summary of  the complaint is distributed by the system to senior  members of the audit, legal and hr teams, as well as  the chief ethics and compliance officer, who decide what further action may be necessary. on a quarterly basis, the senior vice president of   corporate audit reports on whistleblower complaints  to fox senior management and to the audit committee  of the board of directors. the chief ethics and compliance officer also plays a role  in the resolution of complaints, where warranted.  in addition, there may be certain circumstances when  a colleague or anyone with an ethics or compliance  concern believes that they cannot communicate that  concern through regular channels. in such a situation, that person may communicate directly with the lead  independent director of fox’s board, by addressing a letter to the attention of lead independent director,  fox corporation,   avenue of the americas, new  york, ny  . integrity in sports betting  fox sports is synonymous with the best live sports events in the country. the company also operates a licensed sports-betting marketing affiliate site and has other relationships with and involving the licensed u.s.  sports-betting industry. for all those reasons, ensuring  the integrity of sporting events and wagering, and  avoiding even the appearance of impropriety, are critical.   at all times, gaming and broadcast integrity are at the forefront. fox is committed to expanding sports fans’ experience responsibly and ethically. at fox, we never exploit our positions for personal   gain in gaming, broadcasting, or otherwise.  our standards of business conduct demonstrate our  fidelity to our focus on acting ethically and refraining from self-dealing. • as one of the world’s leading sports broadcasters, fox personnel may learn information about  sporting events and athletes before it becomes known to the public. we do not share non-public   information except as part of our journalistic   responsibilities. we never use it for personal gain.  for example, members of the production team  on fox’s broadcast of an nfl football game might learn before the game begins that one team’s starting quarterback suffered a serious injury while warming up—information not yet known to the general public.  any fox personnel learning of this information would  be prohibited from betting on the game and would also be prohibited from sharing the information with friends, family members or acquaintances before it becomes known to the general public. similarly, if the injured football player was a member of the usfl, that player’s teammates would be barred from  sharing the information with third parties.  • fox personnel may not wager with or through a fox-controlled or affiliated sportsbook or marketing affiliate. fox currently does not own majority interest in or control any sportsbook; however, fox’s outkick  media llc, for example, is a licensed sports-betting  marketing affiliate. fox personnel may not open  any account or place any wager through outkick or any other marketing affiliate or sportsbook in  which fox may acquire a majority interest or control in the future. • not only are fox employees required to refrain  from improperly benefiting from their position or  access, they must also guard against family,  household members and others receiving improper  betting advantages. • we do not promote unlawful or unlicensed betting.  fox prohibits its personnel from endorsing,  promoting or otherwise advancing unlawful or  unlicensed sports betting or gambling. • at fox, we always uphold the integrity of sporting events or sports betting that fox broadcasts or  promotes. fox’s unique position as a leading sports broadcaster, coupled with its relationship to the  sports betting industry, necessitates extra care to  avoid even the appearance of impropriety in this area. we avoid taking any step that might be viewed as  creating that perception and promptly report any  incident or event that might do so.  fox employees are encouraged to seek clarification   on the use of non-public information from the legal   department, the chief ethics and compliance officer  and the chief legal and policy officer.introduction about fox our approach  fiscal year   highlights  community forward   people forward sustainably forward policy forward  our policies ethics &
