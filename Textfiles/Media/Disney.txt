cg-aa- b.  learn more in our data & reporting frameworks   disney-branded products are produced in approximately   ,  facilities in more than   countries. this  manufacturing network and global footprint creates   a highly complex network of suppliers, many of them  several degrees removed from our direct operations. in addition, we purchase a vast array of products,  materials, and services from thousands of suppliers   to support our operations, such as theme parks and  resorts; cruise and vacation experiences; film, television,  streaming, and theatrical productions; and offices and  distribution centers. responsible sourcing is an important focus of disney’s  overall corporate social responsibility efforts. we   are focused on respecting human rights, reducing   the environmental footprint of our supply chain,  monitoring the safety and integrity of products,  promoting supplier diversity, and working in  collaboration with others to meet our objectives.  international labor standards we strive to foster safe, inclusive, and respectful  workplaces wherever disney-branded products are  produced. disney has set labor standards for the tens   of thousands of facilities that make disney-branded  products, whether we procure products to sell directly   to the consumer or license our intellectual property to  independent businesses that use their own supply chains. these standards come to life through our international  labor standards (ils) program, which licensees and  vendors producing disney-branded products are  contractually obligated to comply with. the program  is informed by our standards of business conduct , human  rights policy , and supply chain code of conduct , along  with a range of other responsible business expectations.  now in its third decade, the ils program tracks the names  and locations of authorized factories making disney- branded products; sets standards for when, where, and  how social compliance audits confirm compliance with  our standards; and provides guidance to vendors and  licensees on improving the labor conditions of their  facilities, if needed. suppliers are provided onboarding  training and can participate in ongoing training sessions  offered by our team. accountability, transparency & compliance   on international labor standards to promote company-wide integration, our chief  financial officer has responsibility for the ils   program. the audit committee of the company’s   board oversees and periodically reviews the program   and receives updates, generally on an annual basis,  about its performance. we use ils audits as a tool to identify and address  labor-related issues. audits are conducted by either  third-party auditors or disney staff. submitted social  compliance audits are reviewed for compliance with   ils program requirements. corrective action plans   are subsequently sent to licensees and vendors, who   are expected to review them with their facilities and  implement steps to promptly remedy any identified  compliance violations.supplemental guides are made available to our  licensees and vendors to help them work with their  facilities on program compliance. along with an  updated forced labor guide , we also published a   new health and safety guide  in fiscal  . to further  promote program compliance, we regularly refine   our permitted sourcing countries  list and periodically  update our published list of facilities  that produce  disney-branded products that are sold, distributed,   or used in our own retail and wholesale businesses,   as well as those used in our internal operations. in fiscal  , we enhanced and expanded our supply  chain code of conduct (previously named the code of  conduct for manufacturers). the updated code applies  to both branded and nonbranded products, as well as  their upstream components and materials, and formally  recognizes the united nations guiding principles on  business and human rights and the international labor  organization’s (ilo) declaration on the fundamental  principles and rights at work. it also includes, for  the first time, our expectations that suppliers will work  to mitigate their environmental impacts as aligned with  our   environmental g oals.  we are active participants in community efforts to  improve labor conditions in global supply chains,  including the joint forced labor working group,  business at oecd  investment and responsible business  conduct committee, the ilo global business network  on forced labor, ilo better work, and others. learn more about our ils program:   operating responsibly our approach introduction world of hope investing in our people data & reporting frameworks table of contents world in balance world

disciplines, including  medicine, engineering, quality, maintenance,  attraction operations, ergonomics, industrial  hygiene, occupational safety, and food safety. parks safety to support guest safety at our parks, we use innovative  and “smart safety” systems for our attractions. every  night, maintenance teams perform priority maintenance  functions, and our computerized maintenance  management system tracks the completion of each  procedure. the system includes disney-patented  technology that prevents a ride from accepting   guests unless required critical maintenance has   been completed and the ride has been deemed  ready to open for operations. we regularly provide  our cast and crew members safety training and  information through formal instruction, on-the-job  training, and a structured communications process. according to the annual international association of  amusement parks and recreation ride safety report,  administered by the national safety council, the  industry injury rate per million in attendance has  decreased by  % over the past   years, from  .    to  .  injuries. over the past   years, our u.s. disney  parks have reported rates averaging  % below the

 in tip cards, activity books, videos, and other materials  throughout our domestic and international theme  parks and resorts. we’ve extended the program by  providing materials on a streaming platform for our  employees, cast members, and educators to use in  schools and in the community. the lesson-based,  multilingual, global educational program aims to  improve children’s awareness and

bearing disney brands,  characters, and other intellectual property is of   the utmost importance to us. disney-branded  consumer products, spanning numerous categories  from toys and apparel to books and fine art, are  produced by thousands of independent licensees  and vendors around the world. our product safety  program accounts for this breadth, as well as the  rapid changes in scientific knowledge, evolving  regulations, and consumer and community concerns. our product integrity function oversees disney’s   safety policies, procedures, and operating   requirements for physical products containing  disney intellectual property across the enterprise.  disney requires that licensees and vendors  contractually commit to follow sensible, reasonable,  and proper procedures for verifying that disney- branded products comply with applicable safety  regulatory requirements and any additional  requirements that may be specified by disney.  we also have policies to manage the use of chemicals  in products. these require vendors and licensees   to conduct analytical tests by certified third-party  testing laboratories or equivalent procedures,  including testing for chemical levels to verify that, at a minimum, the products meet applicable  regulatory requirements. under the disney product  integrity program, all test reports submitted are  reviewed to verify that the testing was appropriate  and that the proper procedures were performed. in   , we introduced a new requirement prohibiting  the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances— known as pfas—in consumer products developed,  sourced, and distributed by a disney entity. in fiscal  , we updated our supply chain code   of conduct  to include “quality and safety.” although   we had already

environmental sustainability    some previously published environmental data have been  restated to reflect corrections, updates to methodology, and/or  changes in emission factors. fiscal   and fiscal   data  have been revised to include twenty-first century fox operations.   the boundary for disney’s greenhouse gas emissions (ghg)  reporting includes owned and operated assets (such as theme parks  & resorts, disney cruise line, and commercial spaces), leased assets  (such as office locations), as well as productions (including feature  films, television, theatricals, and sporting events). direct co    emissions from biogenic fuels are not included in the scope   totals.  they are as follows: fy :  ,  mt co  e; fy :  ,  mt  co e; fy :  ,  mt co  e; fy :  ,  mt co  e.   ghg emissions are measured and calculated according to the  principles in the world resources institute (wri) and the   world business council for sustainable development (wbcsd)  greenhouse gas protocol’s “a corporate accounting and reporting  standard,   revised edition” (ghg protocol).   market-based emissions are used where available in calculating  carbon credit retirements, total emissions, and net emissions.   we define “net emissions” as follows: scope   emissions + scope    emissions (market-based) – carbon credits. scope   emissions  (market-based) include emission reductions attributed to utility green power purchases, power purchase agreements, and  unbundled energy attribute certificates (eacs). our approach   to carbon credits can be found in our natural climate solutions  white paper . we will have achieved our   “net zero emissions”  goal when “net emissions,” as defined above, equals  .   carbon credits are from projects developed according to  recognized standards (e.g., climate action reserve, verified   carbon standard, gold standard) and retired annually . all credits  are verified by accredited third-party reviewers.   scope   emissions calculations follow guidance provided by the  ghg protocol. in many instances, these emissions calculations are  based on estimated and extrapolated data and rely on third-party  emission factor databases and industry averages. we expect to make  continuous improvements to scope   estimates over time, including  updates to assessments of business activities and activity boundaries,  and improvements in input data and emission factors. at the time   of publishing this report, fiscal   is our most recent scope    inventory, with fiscal   scope   footprint calculation in progress  (to be reported out at a later date).   spend-based methodology estimates emissions for goods and  services by collecting data on the economic value of goods and  services purchased and multiplying that by relevant secondary   (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions   per monetary value of goods).   hybrid methodology uses a combination of supplier-specific activity  data (where available) and secondary data to fill the gaps. this  method involves: collecting allocated scope   and scope   emissions data directly from suppliers; calculating upstream emissions of goods  and services from suppliers’ activity data on the amount of materials,  fuel, and electricity used, as well as distance transported and waste  generated from the production of goods and services, and applying  appropriate emission factors; and using secondary data to calculate  upstream emissions wherever supplier-specific data are not available.   average data methodology estimates emissions for goods and  services by collecting data on the mass (e.g., kilograms or pounds)  or other relevant units of goods or services purchased, and  multiplying by the relevant secondary (e.g., industry average)  emission factors (e.g., average emissions per unit of good or service).   fuel-based methodology involves determining the amount of   fuel consumed (i.e., scope   and scope   emissions of transport  providers) and applying the appropriate emission factor for that fuel.   average product methodology involves estimating emissions   for goods by collecting data on the mass or other relevant units   of goods purchased and multiplying by relevant secondary   (e.g., industry average) emission factors (e.g., average emissions   per unit of good).   distance-based methodology involves determining the mass,  distance, and mode of each shipment, then applying the appropriate  mass-distance emission factor for the vehicle used.   waste-type specific methodology involves using emission factors   for specific waste types and waste treatment methods.   site-specific methodology involves site-specific fuel, electricity, and  fugitive emissions data, and applying the appropriate emission factors.  franchise-specific methodology involves collecting   site-specific activity data or scope   and scope   emissions   data from franchisees.   asset-specific methodology involves collecting asset-specific  (e.g., site-specific) fuel and energy use data and process and  fugitive emissions data, or scope   and scope   emissions data  from individual leased assets.   emissions within this category were evaluated and determined  not to be relevant. activities identified as downstream  transportation and distribution do not result in significant   scope   emissions for the company.   emissions within this category were evaluated and determined  not to be relevant. the company does not have any activities  that it characterizes as intermediate goods.   total energy includes electricity, natural gas, chilled water,   hot water, steam, compressed air, renewable energy, and fuels.   fy –fy  data excludes energy from productions.   percentage grid electricity is purchased electricity consumption  divided by total energy consumption.   percentage renewables is renewable energy consumption  divided by total energy consumption. renewable energy  consumed includes renewable fuels and renewable electricity  that we produce or purchase and match with renewable   energy certificates (recs) or guarantees of origin (gos).   the renewable portion of the electricity grid mix for which we  do not possess recs or gos is not included in this calculation.   data & reporting frameworks our approach introduction world of hope investing in our people operating responsibly table of contents world in balance world of belonging  fiscal   data table   (continued) footnotes   percentage zero carbon electricity is zero carbon electricity  consumption divided by total electricity consumption. we define  zero carbon electricity as any type of electricity generation that does  not generate ghgs such as solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and  large-scale hydropower.   waste diverted includes waste prevention, donations, recycling,  compost, anaerobic digestion, and thermal waste-to-energy. total  waste generated includes diverted waste, waste sent to landfill, and  incineration without energy recovery. incineration without energy  recovery is not counted in total waste sent to landfill nor total waste  diverted—thus the two do not sum to total waste generated.   for total company data, facilities include theme parks & resorts,  disney cruise line, espn, enterprise-owned commercial and office  spaces, and pixar. excluded are all leased properties, disney stores  and distribution centers, tv stations, and all construction materials.   diversion rate includes data from annual facility asset planning  construction projects and construction for new assets that became  operational in the reporting year, in the u.s. and europe only.   the boundary for disney’s water volume reporting includes owned  and operated assets (theme parks & resorts, disney cruise line,  owned commercial and office spaces, studios, and espn). water  consumption from disney stores and leased assets are excluded.  water data for shanghai disney resort were not included in data  prior to fiscal  .   a third-party validator provided limited assurance of our fiscal  ,  fiscal  , and fiscal   ghg emissions. limited assurance of  fiscal   emissions will be reported out upon completion.  social impact   charitable cash contributions include company-directed charitable  cash donations, including contributions made by the disney  conservation fund, as well as employee-directed matching   gifts grants and disney voluntears grants.   in-kind support refers to noncash contributions comprising tangible  items or non-tangible support. donations may include, but are not  limited to, estimated values for merchandise, theme park tickets,  food, public service announcements (psas), character/talent  appearances, and other noncash charitable support. due to  differences in distribution, viewership, programming, availability,  pricing, marketplace demand, and other variables, psas are valued  differently across our media platforms. for example, in some cases,  psas are valued based on an average sales price for the time  period. in other cases, the value is based on an average sponsor value across a daypart rotation. therefore, we do not use a single  method to value psas.   includes grants directed toward historically underrepresented   and protected communities, including asian american & pacific  islander, black & african american, hispanic & latino, native  american & indigenous, and lgbtqia+ communities, as well as  people with disabilities, veterans, and women. we also include  grants to organizations where a percentage of their services  reaches underrepresented and protected communities. if the  organization spends a majority of its efforts on these communities,  we count the entire grant, and if the organization does not   spend a majority, we count a proration of the grant. we rely on each  organization’s self-reported percentages regarding communities  served. on a sample basis, we validate the percentages that we report.   disney voluntears data includes hours logged by employees of  the walt disney company and its subsidiaries and is rounded.   supplier diversity data includes tier   spend with firms that   have obtained certification from a third-party agency as being at  least  % owned, controlled, and operated by a minority, woman,  disabled person, veteran, service-disabled veteran, veteran spouse,  or lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender person. we validate diverse  status through certification compliance using wbenc, nmsdc,  department of veterans affairs, nglcc, and disability:in.  workforce, diversity & inclusion   employee statistics generally reflect our employment base at the  end of each fiscal year.   headcount includes employees at the walt disney company  (twdc), hulu, pixar, disneyland paris, and twenty-first century   fox (tfcf). excludes dailies, freelancers, contractors, and  domestic twdc employees not paid in the last   days.   consistent with our  -k, global employee numbers are rounded   to the nearest thousand.   learning-related data are approximate and rounded. data reflects  courses offered through our top learning platforms: d learn,  harvard spark, harvard managementor, and harvard leading  edge. d learn data represents all employees, excluding pixar and  contract workers for all years and hulu employees prior to fiscal   . data incorporates both required and non-required courses,  including online courses, orientations, in-person classes, and on  demand content. participants can attend more than one course and  may view online content more than once, depending on their  individual needs.  data represents the number of unique courses offered. in csr  reports in prior years, this metric measured the number of  scheduled classes of a unique course. methodology was updated   to better reflect unique courses offered vs. courses consumed.   almost all hourly full-time and part-time nontipped employees   in our u.s. disney parks, experiences and products business earn   a base rate of at least $ /hour, excluding walt disney world  college program participants (this program is not comparable to  other employment opportunities, as it includes other benefits such  as housing and transportation) and disney stores in select regions.  all employees earn minimum wage or higher. median earnings for  hourly employees is based on total earnings for total hours paid  and includes the impact of overtime, shift premiums, and gratuities.  excludes the value of benefits for eligible employees.   headcount includes full-time and part-time employees at   twdc, hulu, pixar, disneyland paris, and tfcf. excludes dailies,  freelancers, contractors, casual seasonal,

excludes  contingent workers, student programs, daily employees, and  seasonal employees. employees that did not disclose gender  information or disclosed they are non-binary/third gender are  included in the men metric. employees that did not disclose  ethnicity information are included in the white metric. data are  not available for fiscal  .  content representation data for scripted & film for fiscal    were restated due to a change in calculation methodology.  updated methodology totals talent by show instead of business  unit, providing a more accurate measurement of representation.  supply chain   the supply chain for disney-branded products experiences  routine fluctuations in active facilities. in any given year, a  significant number of new facilities may become authorized   to produce disney-branded products, which complicates any  year-to-year comparison. in fiscal  , the facility count   shown includes approximately  ,  beyond tier   that are  subject to the purview of the disney international labor  standards (ils) program.   facility footprint data includes all facilities authorized to  manufacture disney-branded products at any point during   the fiscal year. with respect to tfcf intellectual property, as  contracts are newly executed, renewed, or amended with   respect to the manufacturing of products, the facilities producing  such goods fall under the purview of the disney ils program   and are included in the facility footprint data. facility data are  rounded to the nearest hundred.   for country facility data, total facilities are approximate   and rounded.   disney uses the world bank’s governance indicators as the  primary resource for identifying and comparing areas of risk   and determining where to focus our monitoring resources   and requirements. please refer to our permitted sourcing  countries policy .   the disney ils program works toward ongoing and sustainable  improvement in working conditions at facilities producing  disney-branded products. all code of conduct violations  identified in active facilities as the result of audits or assessments  must be corrected or remediated within the time

pluralism description of policies and procedures to  ensuring pluralism in news media contentabc news is committed to diversity & inclusion. there are three pillars to abc news' diversity & inclusion efforts: • people—our people, at all levels, should reflect the life experiences of our audiences. this is reflected across all staffing levels,  correspondents, executives, managers, producers, writers, editors, and junior staff. • content—our work is relevant to a rapidly diversifying audience. this is reflected in the growth of content and story coverage  that focuses on the experiences and interests of diverse audiences at the intersection of race, politics, culture, and lifestyle. • culture—our environment promotes curiosity, innovation, and ideas from everyone. this is reflected in a number of initiatives,  including the news division–wide “everyday inclusion” program, relevant employee committees, and frequent diversity & inclusion  workshops and discussions programmed throughout the year. abc news’s commitment to the straightforward pursuit of truth drives all our work across platforms in established and new-and- emerging technologies. our success lies in our dedication to the highest-quality journalism, which means a commitment to fairness,  compelling storytelling, and, of utmost importance, uncompromising accuracy. we expect employees to approach their work with  rigor, to question thoroughly and skeptically, and to analyze deeply.  we continue to build on the exceptional legacy of abc news, upholding high standards in journalism, while also leading in  innovation. our editorial integrity and commitment to accuracy provide the foundation for the outstanding work that we do.sv-me- a.  journalistic integrity &  sponsorship identification (continued

truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity, fairness, and accountability: it is the mission of abc news to inform the public on matters  of interest and importance to them. the credibility we have with our audience is essential to this mission and we, therefore, attach  great importance to the maintenance of our fairness and integrity—both real and perceived—as we gather and report the news.  company policies on business ethics, fairness, and insider trading apply to all employees in every division, and those policies are  particularly important to abc news employees. we share responsibility for maintaining our reputation for fairness and accuracy.  action that damages that reputation, or even gives the appearance of compromising it, harms both abc news and the individuals  involved. all employees of abc news are, therefore, required to abide by the letter and spirit of our policies and to be alert to  subtle efforts that could have the effect of compromising the integrity of abc news.sv-me- a.    data & reporting frameworks our approach introduction world of hope investing in our people operating responsibly table of contents world in balance world of belonging  sasb index

a neutral and professional manner where  the passions of others are engaged or aroused. we must all share an uncompromising commitment to accuracy and fairness in  reporting the news. we are committed to seeking out knowledgeable and credible sources of information, as well as reaching out  for and carefully evaluating comments from those accused of wrongdoing and others with relevant information and perspectives on  the matters that we are covering. when abc news covers stories about the walt disney company or other affiliated or subsidiary  companies, we make clear disclosures about the
