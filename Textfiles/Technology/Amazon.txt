company with approximately  .  million  full- and part-time employees worldwide and operations in  africa, asia-pacific, europe, india, latin america, the middle east, and north america. we strive to be earth’s most customer-centric company, earth’s best employer, and earth’s safest place to work in the industries in which we operate. everything we do to achieve these ambitions is guided by four principles:  • customer obsession rather than competitor focus  • passion for invention  • commitment to operational excellence  • long-term thinking  our dedication to delighting customers drives us to constantly  invent on their behalf and has led to the launch of many  innovations, including  -click shopping, alexa, amazon echo, amazon studios, amazon web services (aws), career choice, customer reviews, fire tablets, fire tv, fulfillment by amazon, just walk out technology, kindle, kindle direct publishing, personalized recommendations, prime, and the climate pledge.  amazon was built on the belief that with understanding, ingenuity, and innovation, we can more effectively overcome any challenge we face. we believe addressing environmental and societal challenges requires the same mindset. we aim to have a net-positive impact on the world through sustainability because it’s good for the planet, for our business, for our customers, and for our communities. about this report the

reporting  framework summary   .     amazon sustainability report  introduction sustainability people appendix opening  letter from kara hurst reflecting on the last year, i’m proud of the work our teams  around the world have accomplished and i’m excited about what’s ahead. we have taken important steps forward in our social, community, and environmental work, while always expanding our vision for the future. at the center of it all is our customer obsession. sustainability is an important issue for our customers around the world, and we are continually investing, inventing, and improving to make every customer interaction more sustainable than the last. this isn’t a distant vision for the future—this work is well underway now. take our e-commerce business. from the moment a customer clicks “buy now” to when their package arrives on their doorstep, we have teams of scientists and engineers working to make that process more sustainable, all without compromising on speed, safety, or convenience. we are deploying new building technologies, such as low-carbon concrete, to make our facilities more sustainable—as seen in the launch of our second headquarters buildings, which set a new standard for sustainable design. we are investing in renewable energy around the world, and we are the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the world for the third year in a row. our teams are analyzing routes and distances to build a logistics system that gets packages to customers faster, with fewer emissions. and we are transitioning our fleet to roll out  ,  rivian electric delivery vehicles by  , with thousands on the road now.  and that’s just a small part of our story. while our most visible sustainability work may be in how we deliver orders to customers’ doorsteps, we are more than an e-commerce company. amazon is an entertainment studio, cloud provider, grocer, and more—and we are making sustainability a priority across all of our businesses. for example, sustainability might not be top of mind when you tune in to watch your favorite amazon original series, but it is for us. we are reducing the use of fossil fuels from our production studios, deploying battery-electric generators, using solar-powered cast trailers, and scaling the use of electric vehicles on our sets. we are doing all of this in the background while delivering exciting new shows for our customers. cloud computing also plays a role in reducing our customers’ environmental impact. with amazon web services (aws), customers no longer run their own data centers, which often operate at low utilization rates, leading to a lot of wasted energy. instead, customers can take advantage of the advanced engineering of aws data centers that utilize some of the most highly reliable, secure, energy-efficient hardware in the world. aws can lower customers’ workload carbon footprints by nearly  % versus on-premises computing workload, and we expect that number to increase once aws is fully powered by renewable energy. in the communities where we operate, we are also doing our part to help solve rapidly growing challenges facing the world today. take water scarcity as an example. amid unprecedented droughts around the world, we committed that by  , aws data centers will return more water to communities than they use in their direct operations.  no matter the industry, from entertainment to grocery to cloud computing, we are determined to show the world that if we can do this, others can too. in many cases, our work sends important demand signals to the market, which helps drive more renewable energy, more-sustainable building materials, and other innovations that help businesses and organizations around the world reduce their own impact on the environment.  scaling our positive impact is underpinned by the climate pledge—a commitment to be net-zero carbon by  —which we co-founded in  . the pledge invites every sector that touches our business (and those that don’t) to make their own ambitious climate commitments. we are creating a community that inspires each other to do more, and to out-innovate even ourselves as we know we can’t do this alone. more than   companies across   countries signed the pledge by the end of  , and we are determined to keep bringing on new partners to help combat climate change. we are also committed to supporting third parties in their own decarbonization efforts. amazon has one of the largest value chains in the world. as we know the first step in reducing emissions is to understand them, we will continue to work directly with our suppliers, and, starting next year, will update our supply chain standards to require regular reporting and emissions goal setting. we’ll also use our scale, investment, and innovation to date to provide our suppliers with products and tools that will help them reach their goals—whether those are transitioning to renewable energy or increasing access to sustainable materials.  we recognize that sustainability does not have an expiration date, and there will always be more to do. but today, we are taking on some of the hardest problems in the world to solve, with a long-term view, which involves no shortcuts or quick fixes. we remain confident in our approach. you might not see all of the large-scale changes that we are making reflected imminently; our company thinks in the long term. we are working tirelessly to deliver on our sustainability commitments with the impact and scale our customers have come to expect from us, while bringing entire industries along with us and transforming how we work on planet earth.  when we look back at this moment in time, my hope is this: that our teams are immensely proud of the ambitious challenge we took on and the solutions we implemented, and that we have continued to build on our progress to keep thinking even bigger and moving even faster. that our customers see that we remained obsessed with tackling some of the world’s biggest sustainability challenges on their behalf. and that we were willing to make the big bets necessary—even if we wouldn’t see results for years to come—to ensure the next great climate solutions can scale fast to help set our planet back on the right track, and that all future generations can live in healthy, thriving communities. with gratitude,  kara hurst vice president,

approach at amazon, we take on grand challenges, make big bets, and  invent on behalf of customers. that’s exactly how we approach our carbon-emissions reduction: by making a big bet to reach net-zero carbon   years ahead of the paris agreement, then inventing new approaches across our business that will help us get there—all while maintaining the speed, convenience, and reliability that customers expect from amazon. these are incredibly hard challenges. many of the solutions  r equired to achieve global decarbonization don’t exist yet.  and the challenges are also made more complex by the fact that—thanks to strong customer demand—we are a business that continues to grow. meeting the needs of our customers while simultaneously reducing our impact will take time, along with invention and collaboration from all areas of our company. teams across every part of amazon have a decarbonization strategy as part of their long-term organizational plan. we hold ourselves accountable through goal setting and regular reporting. we are investing in breakthrough technology, including promising early-stage decarbonization technology that we back through our $   billion climate pledge  fund. we cannot do this alone. we need governments around the w orld to work together with us as we engage in climate policy  to drive decarbonization at scale. we also need the support  of our suppliers and other businesses, which is why we are building a cross-sector community of companies, organizations, individuals, and partners through the climate pledge. in  , we were joined by   new signatories, including hewlett packard enterprise, maersk, sap, and pwc. they join a community of signatories totaling more than   at the end of  , all committed to reaching net-zero carbon by  , which will have a significant positive impact on the planet. we take inspiration from the progress these companies have made and hope to inspire others with amazon’s efforts to accelerate decarbonization with a global, collective  approach. as we work together on decarbonizing entire industries, it’s d ifficult to reduce or eliminate emissions in certain areas,  because sufficient low-carbon technologies do not exist at scale. but we are not waiting. we are working with industry groups to find solutions for those hard-to-abate emissions, such as from airfreight and cargo

emissions decreased by  . %,  even as our year-over-year net sales grew  %. we achieved this in large part by improving efficiency across our business and continuing our investment in renewable energy. in fact, in  , we announced that we grew our renewable energy capacity by   gigawatts, which was a record for the most announced by a company in a single year and made us the world’s largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for the third year in a row.  our carbon intensity decreased by  % from   to  ,  an d by  % since  . over the last four years, our business  has consistently become less carbon intensive, which further shows we are decoupling emissions growth from our growth as a business. carbon intensity measures grams of carbon dioxide equivalent ( co  e) per dollar of gross merchandise sales (gms).  decarbonizing delivery and logistics  unlike many other companies in the worlds of tech and retail, we have a large logistics network. direct emissions, such as   the fuel used by our delivery fleet, are counted in scope   emissions and make up just under one-fifth of our total emissions. in  , scope   emissions grew by  % year-over-year. this was due to business growth, increased transportation via amazon logistics rather than third parties, and an improvement in the way we calculate emissions, which follows the latest approaches to science-based corporate accounting of emissions. we are making great progress in reducing transportation  em issions where opportunities exist, such as by investing in  electric delivery vehicles. in  , we had more than  ,  of these vehicles in our global fleet, and delivered more than     million packages in the u.s. and europe to customers’  doorsteps with them. we have installed thousands of charging points across our facilities in north america and europe. we deployed e-cargo bikes, scooters, and on-foot deliveries from micromobility hubs, including in manhattan in new york city, and in   cities across europe, from london and paris to marseille and  munich.  we make further reductions by using algorithms to devise the  most efficient routes and locating fulfillment centers and  delivery stations closer to our customers. our packaging team devises smaller and lighter packing options, which take up less space to transport and therefore result in fewer emissions. in fact, since  , we have reduced the weight of outbound packaging per shipment by  % on average and avoided more than   million tons of packaging material. to drive down emissions from long-haul trucking, we launched ou r first electric heavy goods vehicles (ehgvs) in the united  kingdom (uk) and germany. the trucks can weigh up to   metric tons, so the transition relies on the rollout of large-scale charging infrastructure, which also often requires the overhaul of local electricity grids. we are teaming up with ehgv manufacturers to advocate for the changes  required. we are not just using more evs. we already have more than

harder to decarbonize are airfreight and cargo shipping. this is because the net-zero technologies required to move large volumes of goods over long distances by sea and air do not yet exist at scale, nor do the supporting infrastructure or accounting frameworks. yet we are determined to accelerate progress. we are active partners in industrywide coalitions,  including cargo owners for zero emission vessels (cozev),  which we helped launch, and the sustainable aviation buyers alliance (saba), which is focused on increasing investment in sustainable aviation fuel (saf). introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix we are optimistic that emissions will substantially fall across  the transportation and logistics sectors over the next decade. electric vehicle production is becoming mainstream. already, policymakers are encouraging the infrastructure transformation needed to support a new generation of net-zero transportation through measures like the bipartisan infrastructure law and inflation reduction act in the u.s., and the european commission’s green deal industrial plan, which incentivize investment in clean energy. as these changes take effect, they will translate into lower emissions for all companies that, like amazon, transport large numbers of items over thousands of miles. investing in renewables we are proud that our investments in renewable energy, used to power our operations, have resulted in a  % drop in carbon emissions from purchased electricity (scope  ). this now accounts for less than  % of our total reported carbon footprint. in  ,  % of electricity consumed by amazon was attributable to renewable energy sources, and we remain on a path to reach  % by  . electricity powers our data centers, fulfillment centers, physical  s tores, and corporate offices, as well as the evs that charge  at our delivery stations. as a first step, we focus on energy efficiency throughout our operations. we then purchase electricity from renewable energy projects, through on-site solar installations and utility-scale, off-site solar and wind projects. we grew our total number of renewable projects to   in   countries, with a capacity of more than   gw. that’s enough capacity to power the equivalent of  .   million u.s.  homes every  year. key to making renewable energy more impactful is to find ways of s toring it for when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t  shining. we continue to invest in renewable energy projects that are paired with energy storage. additionally, in  , the climate pledge fund invested in electric hydrogen and sunfire, two promising u.s.- and europe-based developers of electrolyzers, which convert water into green hydrogen—an energy source that can be stored for future use. it’s another example of the investment in innovation that amazon is known  for. reducing our scope   emissions activities that take place beyond our direct operations are reflected in our scope   emissions. in  , scope   emissions went down by  . %, despite our year-over-year growth.  we saw a decrease in scope   emissions from building  c onstruction, leased buildings and equipment, and third-party  transportation (as more goods were shipped by amazon’s own logistics providers versus third-party  providers). we know that to further drive down emissions, we must e nsure those in our supply chain make the operational changes  necessary to decarbonize their businesses. to that end, we will update our supply chain standards to require suppliers to share their carbon emissions data with us, including setting goals to reduce emissions as we work together to serve our customers. we will use our size and scale to benefit businesses that are committed to decarbonizing by providing products and tools to both track emissions and help decrease them. and we will continue to look for suppliers that help us achieve our decarbonization vision as we select partners for business  opportunities.  given our success as the world’s largest corporate purchaser of r enewable energy, we will seek to help select suppliers  transition to carbon-free electricity. our potential for impact across our supply chain is big because it spans building materials, transportation, technical equipment, products, and p ackaging, and we look forward to having further impact in  supply chain  decarbonization. to reduce indirect emissions, it’s important to be able to m easure them accurately. we support and fund industry  partnerships to gather more accurate data, including the embodied carbon in construction calculator (ec ), which helps measure embodied carbon in buildings, and the smart freight centre’s global logistics emissions council (glec) framework, a globally recognized methodology for measuring freight transportation  emissions. the road to   decarbonizing our business requires investment that will not always result in immediate outcomes. some of the work that we did in   to reduce emissions is not reflected in our e missions figures for  , and we may not see its impact for  years to  come. like other large corporates and many signatories to the pledge, w e do not have all the answers today, not least because in  many cases the answers do not yet exist or they do exist but are not yet available at scale. we are, however, steadfast in pursuing solutions and working collectively to find the answers and create the demand signals to bring new technologies to scale. we remain focused on reaching net-zero carbon by  , a focus we have maintained since we first announced the climate pledge in  . through innovation, collaboration, determination, and a promise to deliver the best for our customers, we will achieve our goal, and most importantly, contribute to a future on a healthier planet. turbines generate clean electricity at a utility-scale amazon wind farm.     amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions

various other organizations to enhance equitable opportunities for climate tech entrepreneurs, including greentown labs and elemental excelerator.      amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix amazon’s delivery and  logistics network we rely on a complex transportation network to get products  from manufacturers and sellers to customers around the globe. our logistics network spans every step of the journey—from global transportation to    delivery between delivery station and customer. to deliver packages as quickly and efficiently as possible, our logistics network uses different modes of transportation, including ships, planes, freight trains, trucks, vans, and bikes.as well as transporting products in a safe, timely, and efficient manner, we  are decarbonizing transportation across our  business  by:  • increasing fleet efficiency across inbound transportation, middle mi le, and last mile • scaling use of evs and alternative-fuel vehicles  • inc reasing use of low-carbon fuels • partner i ng on initiatives to decarbonize the wider  transport at ion industry  while emerging technologies in sustainable transportation will con t  inue to scale in the coming years, the most effective  way to reduce our transportation-related emissions is through improved fulfillment network efficiencies and supply chain optimization. fulfilling items inventoried as close to our custom e rs as possible reduces the distances packages travel  to reach customers, particularly in middle mile transportation, where long-haul trucking is a large emissions source. shorter routes also make our network more conducive to introducing evs and other lower-impact transportation modes in the long  term. in addition to closing the distance between fulfillment and custom e r, we are working to reduce emissions per shipped unit  by increasing the number of customer orders distributed per trip. for example, we use machine learning algorithms for each order to determine the best packaging solution to eliminate empty space in packages. computer vision and natural language processing guide our system to pinpoint the optimal packaging type for each item—from bag to box—depending on the leve l of protection needed. where possible, we use  lightweight packaging by prioritizing flexible paper bags and envelopes, which are up to  % lighter than similar-sized, rigid corrugate  boxes. we also look to increase the number of items per order, where relevant , encouraging customers to consolidate items into fewer  orders by choosing an “amazon day” for delivery to minimize the emissions associated with fulfilling their order. inbound transportation: the first transportation leg,  used for transporting shipments across international borders. manufacturer products are produced  and assembled. in bound cross dock warehouse operation consolidates loads without intermediate storage.  middle mile: the intermediate transportation leg, where shipments are moved between  amazon facilities. linehaul fulfillment center warehouses store products and serve as distribution centers for associates to pick, pack, and ship orders. lin ehaul, amazon air, rail,  and marit ime shipping linehaul:  intercity portion after freight  is picked u p . air: cargo transportation by amazon air. rail:  cargo transportation by train.  maritime:  ocean cargo transportation. sort center centers sort and consolidate packages to deliver for shipment. last mile: the final transportation leg, where packages are  delivered to customers. linehaul post office deli very station packages are routed to customers through local post offices and delivery stations. fin al delivery customer packages are delivered to the customer’s door.     amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix inbound transportation inbound transportation teams aim to optimize the speed and  cost of cross-border transportation so it’s as simple, fast, and reliable as domestic transportation. amazon is increasing the use of ocean freight for transoceanic  transpor tation, and reducing airfreight when possible. as  an added benefit, ocean transportation has a lower carbon intensity than air transportation, and we continue to reduce the emissions related to ocean freight through the use of biofuels.   compared to road transportation, rail and sea transportation are more carbon-efficient. during  , in north america and europe, we increased our total rail load volume; we continue to grow it at an accelerated rate, which will help meet our net-zero-carbon goals. middle mile  middle mile transportation generally starts when packages  arrive at an amazon facility, such as a cross dock,  and includes  the journey between fulfillment centers, sort centers, and delivery stations. while some trips may be completed by air or train freight, middle mile transportation is usually completed by truck.  trucking is a challenging area to decarbonize, particularly  consideri ng long-haul distances and the requirements for  high-power ev charging infrastructure across transportation routes. there is currently no single solution that can be scaled for decarbonizing middle mile trucking. to help address this challenge, we are experimenting with lower-carbon options, such as trucks powered by renewable natural gas (rng),    battery-electric trucks, and hydrogen-powered  trucks.in  , we piloted a number of electric delivery trucks across north america and europe, with plans for more in  , and we are developing charging infrastructure. we also partner with manufacturers to test and validate new ev models before scaling the technology. notably, we have introduced   fully electric heavy goods vehicles (ehgvs) in germany, which will replace diesel-fueled road miles. five similar vehicles have been added to our uk fleet  . in  , we joined calstart,  and we are collaborating on the electric truck research and utilization center project to advance high-powered charging infrastructure along key freight corridors in california and beyond. low-carbon fuel technologies we are investing in interim ways to reduce the environmental impact of our middle mile truck fleet, including existing lower-emission options powered by rng. we are also investing in future solutions, like green steel   for manufacturing vehicles, as  well as renewably generated green hydrogen.  compressed natural gas (cng) trucks, especially when  powered b y rng created from waste stocks, provide an interim  emissions-reduction technology while ev and hydrogen fuel cell trucks continue to develop. we have procured millions of gallons of rng to power cng trucks in our north american fleet, reducing our reliance on fossil-fuel-based alternatives. we currently have  ,  cng trucks in north america and are partnering with other companies to launch fueling stations to support  them. in august, we also announced a procurement agreement with plug p ower. this partnership will supply amazon  with  ,  tons of green hydrogen per year—enough to power  ,  forklifts annually—for transportation and building operations, starting in   . last mile  last mile transportation refers to the final part of the journey, when products are transported from a post office or delivery station to the customer. traditionally, these trips have been made by gas-powered internal combustion engine vehicles. while these are still common across the industry, we are working to decarbonize our own last mile fleet by utilizing lower-emission options, including evs, electric cargo bikes (e-bikes), and on-foot deliveries. we are expanding our low-carbon electric delivery fleet with  thousan ds of evs. at the end of  , m ore than  ,  rivian  electric delivery vans were on the road in the u.s., and we aim to have  ,  on the road by  . throughout  , we had more than  ,  evs in our fleet and delivered   m illion  packages to customers via ev across the u.s. and europe. we also scaled ev adoption in indian operations, deploying over  ,  evs in our last mile delivery fleet, as well as   m iddle  mile evs, by the end of  .  in  , we announced plans to invest over €   billion  to double  our europ ean zero-emissions fleet for middle and last mile  deliveries over the next five years.  did you know?  amazon offers prime members fast delivery options, including same-day and one-day delivery. we also offer the amazon day delivery option, which gives prime members the ability to choose a designated day of the week to receive their orders. in  , amazon day saved   million boxes. mitigating emissions with micromobility solutions in europe, we have launched micromobility hubs in more than   cities to enable shorter deliveries on foot or by e-bike. in the uk specifically, we launched e-bikes in manchester and london. similar hubs have been installed across france and italy, with further micromobility solutions planned. in the u.s., we continue to improve grocery micromobility  deliver y operations in new york. our efforts to deliver grocery  orders on foot or via e-bike began in   and have since expanded to cover over  .   million orders (over  .   million  packages) in  . this was enabled, in part, by stocking inventory closer to customers. during  , we also introduced new, higher-payload e-bike trailers designed to carry heavier packages. these reduce operational costs by converting sites where deliveries are made on foot to use e-bikes and allowing more deliveries to be completed per bike route. we plan to deploy next-generation micromobility equipment in   . amazon ceo, andy jassy, with a new electric delivery vehicle at amazon’s  seattle headquarters.      amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix partnering for decarbonized  transportation  decarbonizing our transportation business will require cross- company partnerships, which is why we seek to participate in multistakeholder initiatives to shift the industry toward lower-carbon solutions. for our transportation decarbonization partnerships, we leverage two engagement platforms: the sustainable freight buyers alliance (sfba) and the organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) international transport forum. in  , we continued to support the smart freight centre,  wi th a focus on identifying and building partnerships that  can accelerate transportation decarbonization. amazon is also playing an active role in several industry initiatives and government partnerships, including the cozev network, the first movers coalition, and the clean energy demand  initiative.  air  airfreight is one of the modes of transportation we use, and saf is one solution for reducing associated lifecycle emissions. however, saf represents less than  . % of global aviation fuel, because it is still cost prohibitive for most companies.   during  the   united nations climate change conference (cop ), saba announced a digital saf certificate registry that aims to increase transparency for emissions-reduction claims and accelerate saf deployment. as a founding member of saba, amazon played a key role in developing the registry, which will launch later this year.ocean to reduce our ocean-freight-related transportation emissions, ships used to transport goods must transition to using zero-emission fuels. in early  , we co-founded the zero emission maritime buyers alliance (zemba) together with the aspen institute, patagonia, and tchibo. in march  , inter ikea group also joined the alliance. through zemba, freight buyers will accelerate commercial deployment of zero-emission shipping, enable economies of scale, and minimize maritime emissions, helping to get zero-emission ships on the water by the mid- s. land heavy-duty truck freight is another key, yet emissions-intensive, component of most delivery networks, and one we are working to decarbonize through scaling the use of evs. in december  , we co-founded sfba, a group committed to decarbonizing freight operations. members are working to increase demand for medium- and heavy-duty battery evs and charging infrastructure, as well as align on models for fleet electrification. building construction  and operations we aspire to have the most sustainable real estate portfolio in  the world. today, our portfolio comprises thousands of facilities in   countries, including operations buildings (fulfillment centers, delivery stations, warehouses, and sort centers), corporate offices, data centers, and physical retail stores. we aim to reduce emissions across our portfolio through increased energy efficiency, expanding our use of renewable energy, and reducing embodied carbon in construction by using lower-emissions materials.  we use an enterprise building management system (ebms) to  ma nage facility energy use, seeking to use energy as efficiently  as possible to reduce associated emissions. by the end of  , our ebms was active in more than  ,  facilities globally. this standardized platform controls various building systems and has alarms to proactively alert site teams to equipment failures. in  , we plan to expand ebms implementation across our global facilities to help further reduce  emissions.   corporate offices throughout  , our global real estate and facilities team made progress in establishing foundational practices for building and maintaining sustainable buildings. guidelines were developed and shared with internal teams for integrating more-sustainable practices across leasing, design, construction, and operations. we also gathered crucial data to inform building-specific ca rbon-reduction roadmaps and   energy-reduction  projects. using this data, we plan to build a tool to enhance our understanding of current energy and carbon efficiencies and to establish energy performance  targets.  in response to the energy shortage in europe, we quickly im plemented energy-reduction measures that we plan to scale  globally to enhance efficiency across our corporate  buildings.  physical stores in addition to designing new sites with sustainability in mind, we upgraded existing stores with technologies that deliver greater efficiency and carbon emissions savings. physical stores include those for whole foods market, amazon fresh, and amazon go.  international living future institute certification  several of our amazon go stores are seeking zero carbon certification (zcc) with the international living future institute (ilfi). the certification requires locations to lower energy use, eliminate on-site gas combustion, and build using lower-carbon materials. in addition to demonstrating our commitment to the climate pledge, these certified sites serve as test beds for technologies that we can scale across our business.      amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability driving climate solutions carbonpeople appendix the thousands of panes of glass

efficiency  performance by  % from a   baseline, achieving the u.s. department of energy better buildings challenge goal two years ahead of schedule. these improvements were driven, in part, by investing in alternative refrigerants with lower global warming potential (gwp); installing energy-efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac) systems; implementing retrofit projects; and launching an energy-awareness program for st ore operations.  amazon fresh stores in the u.s. and eu also made strides on energy ef f  iciency throughout  , using efficient lighting as  standard in all buildings and expanding the use of doors on in-store refrigerated  cases. natural refrigeration  several retail locations are piloting natural refrigerants with near-zero gwp, as well as low-gwp refrigeration technologies.    as of the end of  ,   whole foods market stores had instal led low-gwp refrigeration systems. an additional    stores have been retrofitted to use next-generation solstice n  refrigerant, which has a gwp approximately  % lower than legacy hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants. all uk amazon fresh stores operate with either natural or low-gwp  systems. reducing natural gas use  we are introducing technologies to electrify systems that traditionally run on natural gas, including kitchen equipment, water heaters, and hvac systems. amazon fresh stores in the uk have moved to fully electric systems, while in the u.s., we are piloting fully electric kitchens in several locations. amazon go has expanded electric hvac equipment in washington state and california.  addressing hard-to-abate carbon emissions we look to address our largest remaining source of buildings emissions—embodied carbon,   primarily in  the concrete and steel used in construction. we use the embodied carbon in construction calculator (ec ) tool to track embodied carbon in our building projects. in  , we tracked embodied carbon from more than   building projects through ec .  throughout  , we partnered with various  organizations to improve embodied carbon reporting. t ogether with introba, we developed a methodology  for understanding and quantifying embodied carbon in material handling and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing equipment. additionally, we collaborated with the chart ered institution of building services engineers  to develop guidance to measure embodied carbon in technologies for the logistics sector. we launched a program to find and validate  transformational technologies as lower-cost alternatives to carbon cr edits  in the most difficult-to-abate areas  of our building portfolio. we have also introduced a technical review committee to assess and recommend promising technologies to improve resource planning.  the

continue delivering optimal service while building  a more sustainable business, aws is designing data centers—including our servers and hardware—for efficiency, resiliency, and a lower carbon footprint.  energy efficiency research shows that in north america, aws can lower customers’ workload carbon footprints by nearly  % compared to on-premises computing workloads, and up to  % once aws is powered with  % renewable energy—a target we are on a path to meet by  .   when servers are in use, they produce heat. if they produce too much heat, it can impact their performance and lifespan. air conditioning systems can be energy-inefficient, which is why we look to maximize use of natural air flow to lower server temperatures and energy use requirements. when we design aws data centers, particularly our data halls, we use models that examine how air moves through spaces. we then create a digital representation of this movement to determine physical properties such as temperature, pressure, and velocity at any location throughout the data hall. this allows us to fully understand how data centers will perform before they’re even built, enabling optimization for higher system reliability and energy efficiency. learn more about how we optimize data center cooling syst ems   .one of the most visible ways we are innovating for power ef ficiency is our investment in purpose-built aws machine  learning chips. our third-generation arm-based chip, aws graviton , is more energy-efficient, as graviton -based elastic compute cloud instances use up to  % less energy for the same performance than comparable amazon ec  instances. in  , we launched aws trainium, a high-performance machine learning chip designed to reduce the time and cost of training generative ai models—cutting training time for some mo dels from months to hours. this, in turn, means building  new models requires less money and power, with potential cost savings of up to  % and energy-consumption reductions of up to  %, versus comparable instances. inferentia is our most power-efficient machine learning inference chip. our inferentia machine learning chip is up to  % m ore

climate solutions carbonpeople appendix embodied carbon aws strives to reduce embodied carbon associated with  concrete and steel, the two most carbon-intensive materials used to build our data centers. this includes carbon emitted during extraction, manufacturing, and transportation of materials to data center construction sites.  we are working with various suppliers on lower-carbon  conc rete options. for example, in northern virginia, aws  worked with building material provider holcim to procure ecopact concrete for several data centers. the concrete mix reduces carbon emissions by nearly  % compared to standard concrete. aws worked with american rock products (arp), a crh company, to develop a more sustainable concrete mix for data centers across northeastern oregon. arp completed environmental product declarations, which summarize environmental impacts across the concrete’s lifecycle, for all products at their plants. globally in  , we completed the construction of   data centers using lower-carbon concrete and   data centers using lower-carbon steel. we expect these numbers to grow considerably in  . we are also focused on reducing embodied emissions as sociated with the manufacturing of aws hardware, including  silicon-based devices like processors and solid-state drives. as these emissions are primarily from material extraction and product manufacturing, the path to decarbonizing chip production involves all parts of the lifecycle. to address this, we are working with suppliers to improve their energy efficiency and power their operations with more renewable  energy.keeping technologies in use longer we are reducing emissions related to server use and networking equipment by increasing server lifespan. this includes refining software to run more efficiently, subsequently lowering stress on hardware and extending its useful life. in  , we extended aws server life from four years to five and networking equipment life from five years to six. to support these efforts, aws has a robust maintenance and repair program designed to increase component reuse and further reduce carbon emissions and waste across our supply chain. to help prevent our equipment from ending up  in landfills and avoid associat ed emissions, we are  investing in responsible end-of-life management systems. aws uses reverse logistics hubs to evaluate and reuse electronic equipment in our global data center fleet. these hubs help us consolidate, assess, and recirculate functional equipment back into our inventory. when we no longer have use for equipment, we remove all customer data and sell the equipment on the secondary market for reuse or work with a network of experienced vendors to recycle parts. to extend the useful life of data center hardware, aws sends all functional,  sanitized, retired server racks and components to its reverse logistics hubs.carbon neutralization the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) has  made clear that significant carbon emissions from several sectors of the economy will not be fully abated by  .   even  with aggressive decarbonization efforts, many companies will need to neutralize some ghg emissions that cannot be eliminated to achieve net-zero  carbon. carbon neutralization represents an opportunity for us to he lp reduce emissions and stabilize our changing climate.  we are focused on three global transformations: halting tropical rainforest loss, restoring degraded land, and scaling technologies that capture carbon  emissions.  learn more about how, in  , amazon analyzed and invest ed in various promising carbon-removal technologies  through the climate pledge fund   . protecting the world’s  tropical rainforests tropical deforestation contributes approximately one-fifth  of global emissions.  ending deforestation will require more  effective government policy, local stakeholder collaboration, and new pathways for sustainable economic development in tropical forest  regions.  in  , amazon helped create the lowering emissions by a ccelerating forest finance (leaf) coalition, which has  mobilized over $   billion  in corporate and government finance  to protect tropical rainforests around the world. in  , during cop , four brazilian states signed letters of intent to participate in the coalition, bringing participating tropical

storage to collect and save clean energy for use when renewable energy sources are unavailable—such as at night or during periods of high demand—and to provide grid stability.  during  , we launched solar projects paired with battery storage capabilities in arizona and california. together, the projects deliver   m w of energy, alongside   m w of  battery storage. across our portfolio, we now hold   m w of  storage capacity. we are looking to increasingly pair renewable generators with storage to provide near  /  carbon-free electricity on grids with significant solar.  while storage solutions have the potential to meet energy  requirements when supply isn’t readily available, current constraints, such as high costs, mean we continue to pilot storage on a small scale. supporting a just clean energy transition as the world’s largest corporate renewable energy purchaser, we have a unique role to play in supporting a just, equitable, and sustainable clean energy transition. in may  , amazon became a founding member of beyond the megawatt—an initiative by the clean energy buyers institute (cebi) to maximize the environmental and social benefits of the clean energy transition.  as a member, we support beyond the megawatt’s efforts  to address resilience, social equity, and environmental protection issues by scaling impact-oriented clean-energy procurement strategies. the development of industrywide procurement standards to promote social impact and human rights within clean energy buying is critical to this partnership. these standards are expected in  . a global clean energy transition will also require increased supplies of minerals that power more-sustainable technologies. this rise in demand has the potential to benefit millions through inclusive economic

the emissions data ecosystem • enhance emissions accounting governancewith the introduction of more renewable energy  options into electrical grids globally, the variability of generation mixes increases, resulting in carbon emissions that vary substantially based on time and location. with this in mind, it’s more important than ever that decision-makers opt for renewable electricity options that maximize emissions reductions. making the right electricity choices relies on accurately understanding the most significant decarbonization opportunities. learn more about the  emissions first principles  .advocating for renewable  energy solutions amazon seeks to accelerate global adoption of cleaner energy  options through public policy  engagement. in the u.s., the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) is driving efforts to modernize the electricity grid. this work is important because grid-enhancing technologies (gets) can bring renewables to more people by unlocking capacity and improving efficiency. gets also complement the advancement of new transmission infrastructure. combined, this means faster, more cost-effective deployment of clean energy. we ha v e publicly stated our support of ferc’s proposal to  require incorporation of corporate energy commitments into long-term planning for bringing new renewable resources onto the grid. we also support policy development for accelerating how new renewables are connected to the grid, encouraging ferc to update the process for integrating wind, solar, and storage projects into the national energy  mix.  we seek to advance national renewable energy goals where we operate. for example, in indonesia, we plan to buy electricity from third-party solar parks being installed in bali and java and connected to the java-madura-bali grid. not only will this help renewably power our local operations, it will also support indonesia’s goal to increase the use of renewables. looking forward we will continue exploring ways to renewably power our operations, introducing new wind, solar, and storage projects to reduce our reliance on carbon-based energy sources. throughout  , we will identify new technologies that accelerate renewable energy deployment and, ultimately, help us achieve our net-zero carbon emissions goal. we will also engage additional device component suppliers to establish renewable-energy implementation  plans.     amazon sustainability report   |  introduction sustainability peo ple appendi x reducing pac kaging and waste packaging packaging packaging is one of the

circular economy for materials and products, not only can we keep valuable resources in use for longer, but we can also reduce related impac t s such as carbon emissions and environmental  pollution.  we are working to eliminate waste and increase recycling and reuse a cross our business. we are also optimizing product  design and providing our customers with opportunities to repair, resell, recycle, and repurpose products and materials.  amazon’s approach for materials use this waste hierarchy is a framework that helps guide our approach to  managing and avoiding waste. it represents the most preferred option at the top to the least preferred at the bottom. we are focused on reducing our impact by pursuing opportunities that are more preferred before moving down the hierarchy.  avoidwe improve product and packaging design, inventory management, materials sourcing, and resource use to avoid or eliminate waste generation from the start.  reducewe pur sue avenues such as increased product durability and  resal e to reduce waste. reuse wher e possible, we repair, repurpose, and donate usable items. recyclewe recycle and compost to recover raw materials where possible,  inclu d ing food  waste. incineration with  energy recoverywhere avoidance, reduction, reuse, or recycling aren’t possible, we  target energy recovery. landfill and  incineration without energy recoverythis is a last resort for materials and products that currently cannot be diverted  to better recovery pathways. for example, some hazardous products and materials must be disposed of in this manner for health and safety reasons. avoiding and  managing waste waste is generated in both our direct operations, including  some subsidiaries, and in our supply chain. we classify it by two categories: internal (direct) or external (indirect). direct waste is produced inside amazon’s organizational boundaries; indirect waste is generated by third parties (e.g., suppliers, customers). the primary materials streams for amazon’s footprint include:  • operations:  this covers any waste from amazon’s internal  operation s and falls into two categories: noninventory and  inventory  (product).  – noninventory materials streams include nonproduct  materia l (i.e., goods not intended to generate revenue)  that is discarded. this includes used office furniture, corrugate, shrink wrap, break room waste, and damaged storage  equipment. – inventory materials streams include heavily damaged and unsold  products, customer returns that cannot be repaired,  food that is no longer safe for consumption, unused nonfood inventory, and goods that cannot be donated, sold via wholesalers, or sold on amazon warehouse.     à food waste:  foo d-related waste is generated in our  amazon  kitchen manufacturing facilities, physical  grocery retail stores, and fulfillment  centers.  • customer:  waste generated at the customer product-use  phase o r in the form of product and delivery  packaging   ,  including end-of-life  impa cts. • construction:  waste generated from construction  activ ities related to building our facilities. consists mainly of  comingled construction and demolition waste like metals, masonry, asphalt, and  drywall. • supply chain:  in addition to our direct footprint, we are  focus ed on reducing supply chain waste, which is waste  generated by third-party suppliers who manufacture products for, and provide goods and services to, amazon.    amazon sustainability report  introduction sustainability reducing packaging and waste  waste and circularitypeople appendix our progress operational waste operational waste  is what we can most directly control and  impact. we manage operational waste generated across our  business, including grocery, retail, e-commerce, office buildings, and data  centers.  noninventory materials management noninventory waste is generated from materials used to run our businesses. corrugate represents one of our largest noninventory materials streams and we work closely with third-party recycling vendors to remove excess corrugate for off-site recycling. we are also scaling single-stream recycling, composting, and plastic film recycling across our operations. we strive to avoid electronic waste generation and, when this is not possible, focus on reuse and recycling. we pursue solutions and industry partnerships to advance  more beneficial end-of-life path ways for materials. we also  continually improve our data architecture to enhance waste tracking and management. additionally, in  , we launched a centralized waste-collection initiative across select corporate buildings in the u.s. to replace desk-side bins with communal alternatives, which is expected to increase waste diversion by  %.  aws waste reduction through  reverse logistics amazon web services (aws) is embracing circular economy  principles for our server racks by designing reusable and lower-carbon rack systems, keeping equipment operating efficiently, and recovering value from securely decommissioned equipment through reuse, repair, and recycling. this allows us to keep resources at their highe st value for as long as  possible—reducing waste generation from our global operations, and decreasing the use of raw materials and carbon emissions across our supply chain. we are focused on three  priorities:  • design:  at aws, server rack circularity and sustainability begin  with design. we focus on eliminat ing excess materials such  as steel or plastic, increasing recycled and bio-based content, and planning for repair, reuse, and recycling from the start. • operate:  using our equipment for as long as operationally  efficient reduces the carbon fo otprint associated with using  hardware. in  , we extended aws server life from four years to five and that of networking equipment from five years to six. in addition, aws has a robust maintenance and repair program designed to increase component reuse and further reduce carbon emissions and waste across our supply  chain. • recover: when it is time for server racks to be  decommissioned, sanitized eq uipment is routed to our  reverse logistics hubs in the u.s. and ireland. these hubs test, repair, and recirculate non-media-storage equipment back to data centers or to be sold for reuse by third parties. we do this on a global scale, funneling all retired rack systems through our dedicated reverse logistics network. centralizing the decommissioning process also allows aws to optimize component reuse across our data centers, taking decommissioned equipment from one facility and redeploying it to serve demand elsewhere. inventory management amazon inventory management primarily involves items returned by customers, damaged in handling, or that are overstock. items that fit these descriptions are considered for resale, reuse, repair, or donation. we maximize product recovery through discount cha nnels, such as outlet, amazon  warehouse, and selling to  wholesalers. we take a circular approach to equipment, designing for reusability and operational efficiency, and recovering value through reuse, repair, and recycling.   customer returns avoidance: we want to help customers keep what they bought for as long as possible with product lifecycle support (pls) options that let people address post-purchase product issues. we currently offer three free post-purchase care options: original equipment manufacturer (oem) support and oem repair, where customers can go straight to the manufacturer for support; self service, which helps customers address issues themselves; and parts replacement, where customers can request available components to replace damaged or missing parts, free of charge. in  , pls

fficiency • use more-sustainable  sources • reuse cooling  water • invest in water replenishment  accomplishing our goal requires cross-team collaboration, wit h input from engineers, operations experts, commissioning  professionals, and those with sustainability  oversight.   increasing water efficiency we are continuing to invest in data center water use efficiency (wue) in three ways. it begins with our preferred efficient evaporative cooling design, which uses outside air rather than water to cool data centers for much of the year. during hotter months when water is needed, outside air is cooled through evaporative processes and pushed into server rooms to keep hardware at stable operating temperatures. second, we incorporate real-time alarm systems to enable timely responses to any issues that could cause water waste. finally, we update operational sequences to optimize water use and employ on-site water treatment to increase water recycling. with this strategy, our global data center wue was   .  l/kwh  in  , a  % improvement from  .  l/kwh in  .using more-sustainable  water sources  we seek to reduce potable water consumption where  possible, relying on alternatives like recycled water and rainwater harvesting. as of  ,   data centers use recycled wastewater in cooling systems—  in virginia, two in california, and two in singapore. in brazil, two data centers collect rainwater to supply a portion of cooling water needs.  in several regions, we partner with community stakeholders  to ex pand recycled water infrastructure. doing so helps build  local resilience against increasing climate change-related water issues such as drought. in  , we worked with local government and water utilities in loudoun county, virginia, to expand the infrastructure network that delivers recycled water to the community. we are working with several other municipalities to scale similar  infrastructure. reusing cooling water  water discharged from data centers is safe for many uses, and we seek ways to return it to the communities in which we operate. to confirm water quality is maintained, we closely monitor it throughout our systems.  investing in water replenishment we are focused on restoring watersheds and increasing access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services in water-stressed communities. in  , aws completed projects with water.org   and wateraid to provide clean water and sanitation to over     ,  people across india and indonesia.  amazon is also partnering with water.org to launch the water   & cli mate fund   . the initiative will enable climate-resilient   water and sanitation solutions that create lasting access to safe  water sources for   m illion people across asia, africa, and   latin america. the fund will support projects including water   reuse infrastructure, wastewater treatment plants, and water   loss reduction. in addition to supporting the creation of the   fund, amazon’s $   m illion planned contribution will directly   empower   million people with water access by  . this will   provide   billion  liters of water in water-scarce areas annually   and represents one of the largest private investment portfolios   in water and climate to date.  in england, aws is collaborating with the rivers trust to create   wet land areas in the thames river basin. these wetlands will   recharge groundwater and improve water quality by naturally   filtering polluted runoff. in california, aws has worked with   the freshwater trust and the omochumne-hartnell water   district to recharge

introduction sustainability protecting natural resources  | waterpe ople appendix operations, physical  stores, and offices  operations across amazon operations, teams are working to reduce water  use, with some currently identifying baseline water use and others already analyzing usage data to target reductions.  india is one of the world’s most water-stressed countries.  to red uce water use in india operations, we have an active  stewardship program and have adopted the water neutrality index (wni)   as a key metric. as of  , india operations  ach ieved a wni score of   for   in-scope operations  facilities  and aims to achieve water positivity  for these same  fac ilities in   .  adam selipsky, ceo of aws, at the   re:invent conference where aws  announced its goal to be water positive by  .we achieved this wni score, in part, by designing buildings  with rainwater-harvesting systems. additionally, these facilities recycle greywater—water from domestic streams such as sinks, cafeterias, and washrooms—for irrigation and flushing water for toilets. more-efficient fixtures such as waterless urinals and water restrainers for high-flow fixtures contribute to a reduction in washroom consumption. in all future sites in india, we plan to include rainwater-harvesting pits and meters, water-recycling systems, and efficient fixtures. we aim to improve data accuracy and will begin implementing a water use index, which tracks water consumption in relation to building footprint. in the united kingdom (uk), we are piloting a rainwater- harv esting system in wales, while installation of low-flow  fixtures is underway across new and existing fulfillment sites. in  , uk operational facilities implemented an active water leak detection program to proactively identify and address issues. planning is underway to scale this pilot globally.   physical stores by the end of  ,   whole foods market stores installed a new defrosting system that recycles meltwater instead of allowing it to run down the drain. this new system can reduce up to  . % of water use associated with defrosting. in  , we are assessing the potential to scale this technology to other whole foods market stores.  corporate offices in global corporate offices, we are increasing water recycling and low-flow fixtures. amazon set new standards for construction design in the u.s. to reduce indoor water use by  % versus a leadership in energy and environmental design (leed) baseline. we are scaling these standards globally. in  , the first phase of amazon’s second headquarters in arli ngton, virginia, was under construction. water-efficient  features for the two office towers, known as met park, include low-flow fixtures, domestic hot water heat pump heat recovery, rainwater and greywater capture and reuse systems, and groundwater heat-exchange  systems.  the recycling systems in met park alone are designed to save over   .  mi llion gallons of water annually, while groundwater  heat exchange will reduce annual cooling tower water usage by  ,  gallons. additionally, landscape areas are irrigated with  % reclaimed and treated greywater. altogether, met park is designed to reduce indoor water consumption by  % (compared to a leed v  baseline), reduce cooling tower water con sumption by  %, and eliminate potable water use for  irrigation. all in, met park is projected to use half as much water as similar-sized  buildings.  looking forward throughout  , we made progress across regions and businesses to improve wue. to build on this, we have launched a companywide water dashboard for greater oversight of site-by-site usage. in  , we will focus on data maturity and use insights to drive continual improvements.  the terrace gardens at our headquarters in arlington,

amazon products to support responsible supply  chains and contribute to growing circular economies. from groceries and cleaning supplies to fashion and devices, we carefully consider the materials and lifecycle impacts across our product categories.  in  , we developed a responsible sourcing roadmap  infor med by findings from our first comprehensive commodity  risk assessment for amazon devices and amazon private brands products. the roadmap focuses on key materials, including cotton, wood, pulp, paper, cobalt, and copper, and guides businesses in achieving greater visibility and positive impacts across our supply chains.  in december of  , amazon private brands and whole foods  mark et publicly committed to limit deforestation risks in food,  grocery, and consumable private brands products containing palm oil, soy, paper products, beef, cocoa, coffee, and tea. additionally, we successfully achieved previously published apparel goals on man-made cellulosic fibers and cotton. to ensure better standards for cotton more widely, we continue to sponsor and participate in the responsible sourcing network’s due diligence initiative, yess (yarn ethically & sustainably sourced), to identify and address forced labor in cotton production. in  , yess released its first standard for fabric mills and an updated standard for spinning mills, enhancing efforts to improve cotton supply chain due diligence. beyond responsible commodity sourcing, amazon private brand s is making progress toward measuring environmental  impacts in our supply chain and promoting safer chemistry. as part of the sustainable apparel coalition, we encourage suppliers to evaluate their practices using the higg facility environmental module (fem), a self-assessment which evaluates performance and prioritizes opportunities for improvement across seven impact areas: air emissions, carbon emissions, chemicals management, environmental management systems, waste, wastewater, and water.  in  , we joined the copper mark, which oversees the world’s only c omprehensive social and environmental assurance  program for the copper industry. we also participate in the responsible minerals initiative’s working groups devoted to smelter engagement and, in  , became governance committee members of the public-private alliance for responsible minerals trade.  additionally, in  , we supplemented our existing  formulated products restricted substance list    and food  contact materials restricted substance list    with a new  commitment to comply with the apparel and footwear international rsl

appendix      amazon sustainability report  upskilling our employees  in  , we launched our upskilling   pledge with a  commitment to upskill  ,  employees by  . in  , we announced we would triple that commitment by   to provide prepaid education and technical skills training to help  ,  hourly employees move into higher-paying roles. to achieve this goal, we maintain   global upskilling programs with various eligibility requirements. through these, we offer prepaid education, industry certifications, technical skills training, and apprenticeships to meet employees’ needs, no matter where they are on their professional journeys.  one of the most notable upskilling opportunities we offer is  career choice  , a program providing employees with skills  training, professional certificates, language learning, and college degrees. over  ,  employees have participated in career choice since it launched in  , receiving support from a global network of over   educational partners. in  , we extended career choice courses for eligible u.s. employees to include english as a second language (esl), high school completion programs, and prepaid college tuition. to prepare employees for future environmental sustainability roles, we introduced three new career choice pathways that lead to environmental technician, energy technician, and solar technician career opportunities. employees can also pursue industry certifications for in-demand fields like transportation and environmental sustainability, or a bachelor’s degree with one of our partner schools. career choice is just one way to give employees access to  the edu cation needed to take on in-demand, higher-paying  jobs. examples of other upskilling initiatives we offer include the amazon technical apprenticeship program, which helps military veterans transition into tech careers, with many apprentices converting into full-time employees with amazon, and machine learning university, which teaches machine learning capability to those with basic skills in software development. we view these as important investments in our employees and in the communities where we operate.  alongside career choice updates, we announced additional  new and e nhanced programs in  , including:   • surge it:  an update to our existing surge it program, with  a pilot t hat expanded it to employees with nontechnical  backgrounds who are interested in a career in it.   • sustainability training: we engaged  ,  employees  on sust ainability programming,  ,  of whom completed  training

leaders, raising issues, and suggesting improvements.   employee feedback mechanisms  we continually gather employee feedback to support our aim of meeting evolving employee needs. throughout  , to improve feedback mechanisms, we expanded our employee relations centralized investigation team to cover the u.s., canada, mexico, costa rica, the united kingdom (uk), egypt, the united arab emirates, and saudi arabia, instead of managing this work locally. we also introduced a new u.s. workplace investigations excellence training program, which was delivered to over  ,  human resources (hr) professionals.  amazon maintains mechanisms for employees to voice concerns  of unethical conduct, including an ethics line for  anonymously report i ng potential violations of our code of  busine ss conduct and ethics   .  employees have several feedback routes. while not all-encom passing, investigations provide a snapshot of various  avenues and a reflection of where most feedback is received. employees can access escalation mechanisms through the ethics line, executive escalation, their manager, and hr business partners, to name a  few.  associate roundtables, forums, and  safety committees  associate roundtables are held regularly for leadership and  hourly employees to discuss pressing issues. associate forums create opportunities for employees to connect with site leaders on decisions that impact the site or employee experience. in  , we held more than   forums across the uk, poland, slovakia, czech republic, spain, and  morocco.  globally, various sites also

myvoice achieved a  total reach of  . % of amazon stores globally.   appeals  we maintain a defined appeals process. across the u.s. and canada, eligible employees can use an online, paperless appeals service to challenge certain disciplinary actions. claims are reviewed by the applicable manager to verify policies have been correctly applied. where this is not the case, appropriate remediation can then be taken.   we are continually updating the process and centralizing it across  u.s. and canadian customer fulfillment and sort center  operations. during  , amazon logistics enhanced appeals for hourly employees, making it easier for people to speak up and share their opinions.   learn more about our approach to ethical business  . freedom of association  we respect freedom of association and our employees’ right to form, join, or not join labor unions or other lawful organizations of their choosing, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. these rights should be exercised in an informed and thoughtful manner.  globally, amazon applies or is party to dozens of collective bargai ning agreements at national, regional, sectoral,  and enterprise levels. in  , we established a european works council; we held our first meeting in april  . in march  , we reaffirmed our position on freedom of associ ation  , including our approach to human rights and  collective bargaining.  looking forward  in the u.s., we are exploring new avenues for supporting employees’ financial health; in europe, we have set a   benefits roadmap that focuses on health care, finance, and time away from work. and, because every person’s circumstances are unique, we will strive to advance our offering, including family planning tools, to reach employees with the resources they need. we also seek to scale training opportunities, adding additional resources to career choice and offering new programs. to prepare more employees for future sustainability roles, we are working to build new pathways for in-demand roles and programs to upskill our workforce.   we continually look to evolve the employee experience. to  understa nd where there’s room for growth, we will enhance  engagement channels and identify strategic imperatives. with greater insight into employee sentiment, we can then work on delivering benefits and training opportunities that more closely align with people’s needs.

goal is to be the safest workplace across the industries  in which we operate. we use a risk management approach to guide our prioritization and decision-making, which includes:  • measuring safety performance to assess program effecti veness and to identify and remove hazards •assessing safety processes and adherence to standardsthrough au dits and inspections •engaging employees to continually improve safety inour operation s we use various measures to mitigate operational safety risks. we also inv est in high-impact solutions that make machines,  equipment, and processes safer, while implementing preventive measures such as training, standard operating procedures, and personal protective equipment.  our efforts are guided by a management system that aligns w ith international organization for standardization  (iso)  : —a voluntary international standard for health and safety management. to drive continuous improvement, we measure progress against two kinds of indicators:  •lagging indicators, such as incident rates. •leading indicators, which are preventive measures. our leadi ng indicators include data from inspections, assessments, audits, employee and leader surveys, one-to-one conversations, focus groups, and on-site observationsfrom employees. our progress  measuring safety  performance  data helps us assess the effectiveness of our efforts and  identify potential improvement areas. it also equips operations leaders and safety professionals with measurable, objective insights that support risk detection and mitigation. with this in mind, we track two metrics that help us understand annual safety performance:  •recordable inc ident rate (r ir): denotes how often an  injury or ill ness occurs at work—measured  in injuries per   ,  working h ours—according  to local occupat ional  safety and hea lth reporting requirements . •lost time inc ident rate (ltir): measur es the number of  injuries and illnesses per    ,  working hours that resu lt  in  time away from work.   when examining   against  , we are proud to report our global rir has improved by  %, while global ltir improved by  %.   between   and   alone, we  improved rir by  % and ltir by  %. of recordable incidents reported in  , about  % resulted from work-related musculoskeletal disorders. the remaining  % were primarily due to slips, trips, falls, and falling objects. progress since   is due, in large part, to our long-term strategy  for continuous improvement. many practices that  were underway prior to the pandemic—including employee engagement and physical and mental health support—continue to be foundational. and we’ve continued building on them with new technologies, including artificial intelligence (ai), robotics, sensors, and innovative engagement tools and learning methodologies.   as well as reducing rir and ltir, we work every day to help prev ent injuries and tragedies, such as fatalities, in our  workplaces. sadly, sometimes they do occur from personal health causes, natural disasters and work-related activity. in  , we lost three amazon employees in the u.s. to work-related fatalities, which is defined as an occupational injury or disease sustained or contracted during an employee’s tenure with their employer. we provide support and counseling to any employee who may need it following such a tragedy. in each instance, we conduct thorough internal investigations, implement corrective actions, and work with regulatory authorities as they conduct their own independent reviews.  while safety metrics include only amazon employees, we are also dri ving advancements for business partners within our  fulfillment, freight, and delivery networks.  learn more in our   safety, health, and well-being report  . safety

employee health and safety appendix  assessing safety processes  audits and inspections assure that effective resources and  protocols are in place for identifying, eliminating, or controlling safety hazards. during inspections, we check that our safety measures and controls are working to reduce or mitigate potential risk, as designed.  inspections include checks of critical safety controls for high-risk operations such as contractor maintenance, machinery use, maintenance and repair, dock and yard safety, and powered industrial truck operations. in  , we conducted over  .  million inspections globally, up from  .  million in  .  auditing verifies our compliance with national and international regulations and standards in over   jurisdictions globally. we  conduct audits for areas such as occupational health, safety management, and facility and technical safety. findings are tracked by our management system and used to identify root causes, improve compliance, and update internal standards and procedures.  did you know?  we encourage anyone interested in seeing our fulfillment facilities to sign up for one of our amazon tours, either virtually or in person. more than   million people experienced our tours in   and  . engaging employees  on safety  in  , we improved our employee-led safety observation  program to make it easier for employees to share suggestions and concerns. as well as representing another leading indicator against which to track progress, the observation program helps facilitate timely, meaningful conversations on safety topics, helping leadership engage with the issues that are most important to amazon employees. we are encouraged by the preliminary results we are seeing and the potential reduction in lagging indicators as a result of this program.  as well as providing effective communication routes, we seek to enhance understanding through safety trainings that help  people take ownership of their own safety. employees receive critical safety information on their first day of employment, followed by job- and process-path-specific training. during  , mental health awareness training was delivered to thousands of managers, with guidance on what to do if mental health concerns arise at work. we also enhanced our worldwide emergency response preparedness training with realistic emergency scenarios. this was further strengthened with an on-site tour to highlight visible cues and provide clear instruction on how to handle shelter or evacuation events.  learn more about how we engage employees on safety through  associate safety committees   .  our safety leadership index  in  , we created the safety leadership index (sli) to measure employee and leader perceptions of safety. the index helps us get ahead of safety risks by gathering feedback through monthly questions, delivered via employees’ scanners and computers.  questions cover topics such as sentiment around leaders’ safety commitment, saf ety awareness,  safety structures, safety involvement, and safety accountability. feedback is anonymous, confidential, and intended to drive improvement. in  , we engaged over  .  million operations employees through the sli across more than  ,  sites in   countries.    amazon sustainability report looking forward  we continue to invest in safety-related projects across amazon and will invest approximately $  million in  . these projects include capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered ergonomic solutions that aim to reduce and eliminate risks.  we are constantly striving to improve safety for our employees, partners, and communities every day. we know  there is more work to do on our journey to become the safest employer across the industries within which we operate. our commitment to safety has never been stronger—and it will only continue to grow.  amazon ceo, andy jassy, and ceo of worldwide amazon stores, doug  herrington,

experiences everywhere. amazon has changed the world through its focus on the customer—and we are approaching dei and accessibility the same way. our strategy focuses on using technology wherever possible to create inclusive experiences for employees, customers, and communities around the world.  • employee experience: guided by amazon’s leadership principles, we are committed to a culture that creates a safer, more productive, more diverse, and more just work environment. as a part of this, we are building equitable and inclusive experiences for our people, and into our products, processes, and programs.  • community experience: with our size, speed, and innovative culture, we take bold, deliberate action to drive change on a global scale. through our inclusive products, services, and touch points in neighborhoods around the world, amazon aims to be a leader in using science and data to help achieve a more equitable society for the future.  • customer experience: we work backward from our customers in everything we do. from deliveries at the front door to satellites in space, we are focused on creating accessible solutions that make life easier for people of all backgrounds. we set three priorities in  :  • accelerate inclusive experiences outside of the u.s.: we deliver global initiatives for indigenous people,  the lgbtqia+ community, military veterans and their spouses, and people with disabilities. we are making self-identification available in countries where amazon currently operates. where legally allowed, employees can voluntarily share their demographic characteristics, which helps us better understand their needs and drive more impactful programming.  • advance dei through technology: we see an opportunity to address the needs of the future by taking an approach  that blends human judgment and artificial intelligence. while it’s still early, we are already seeing that technology helps us inspect and remove potential bias from our people processes and improve human decision-making. this will help us accelerate our progress at scale across every aspect of the workplace.  • take a more holistic approach to dei in our talent strategy: we use data and science to find opportunities to improve the experience across the entire employee lifecycle, optimizing processes related to hiring, onboarding, professional development, promotion, and retention. this includes continued investment in our existing upskilling programs, such as our global mentorship program, and amazon technical academy, which trains nontechnical

our sdi approach, we seek to include more diverse- owned and small businesses in our procurement processes.   in  , we focused on increasing the diversity of certified u.s. tier   suppliers—companies we contract with to provide  goods and services, such as marketing, construction, and professional services to operate our businesses .  we look to external organizations to confirm the diversity of our supply chain. being certified as a diverse supplier with amazon requires valid certification from one of five major u.s .  supplier diversity agencies: • the national minority supplier development

nglcc, nvbdc, and u.s. black chambers events . standardizing sdi  operating procedures and ensuring oversight  we depend on supply chain partners who reliably provide  goods and services across amazon to keep us running seamlessly. our supplier network spans the globe, and we want to drive our sdi efforts wherever we operate. throughout  , we continued building fundamental sdi procedures to meet industry best practices, gathering stakeholder insights and defining plans to expand sdi globally .  to make it easier to connect, in  , we launched supplier connect, a vendor registration portal
