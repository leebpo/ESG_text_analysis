to support  our values. for example, in january  ,  apple, along with other leading companies,  filed an amicus brief  in support of the epa’s  authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions  because that authority “is critical to combatting  climate change.” in november  , apple filed a lawsuit against  nso group and its parent company to hold it  accountable for the surveillance and targeting  of apple users. the complaint provides new  information on how nso group infected victims’  devices with its pegasus spyware. to prevent  further abuse and harm to its users, apple is  seeking a

lifetime use of our products. and today, nearly   percent of the  materials in our products were made from recycled content — a number we’re working  to increase. across our environmental work, we’re also committed to being a force for equity. we’re  working with communities on the frontlines of climate change and the next generation   of diverse entrepreneurs to create shared opportunity and to build a more just world. our approach the environmental challenges we face today  are significant, and we’re responding with  urgency and dedication. we approach our work  by focusing on fundamental questions. what  matters most? and where can we make the  greatest impact? these questions guide our  work across our strategic focus areas of climate  change, resources, and smarter chemistry  — and inform our goals in how we can best  achieve change.  we know we’re not alone in working to reduce  our environmental footprint. so we’re engaging  with others to support our efforts and find  opportunities to lift local communities along  the way.  setting ambitious goals is essential to our  approach — to drive the innovation and  collaboration that makes change possible  and to be transparent and accountable to  our progress. our work is led by lisa jackson, apple’s vice  president of environment, policy and social  initiatives, reporting directly to ceo tim  cook. the environment, policy and social  initiatives team works with other teams across  apple to set strategy, engage stakeholders,  and communicate progress. our integrated  approach means that decisions

toward our goals.which we achieved in  . and in  , we  reached the milestone of being carbon neutral  for our corporate operations, including direct  emissions as well as business travel and  employee commute. our  -year climate roadmap is addressing  apple’s carbon footprint through five pillars: low-carbon design:  we will design products  and manufacturing processes to be less  carbon-intensive through thoughtful material  selection, increased material efficiency, and  greater product energy efficiency. energy efficiency:  we will increase energy  efficiency at our facilities and in our supply  chain by finding opportunities, such as  retrofitting, to reduce energy use. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     renewable electricity:  we will continue to  source   percent renewable electricity for  our facilities, and transition our entire supply  chain to   percent clean, renewable sources  of electricity. direct emissions abatement:  we will   reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions in   our facilities and our supply chain through  process innovation, emissions abatement, and  the use of non- fossil -based low -carbon fuels. carbon removal:  working in parallel with  our emissions reduction efforts, we will scale  up investments in carbon removal projects,  including nature -based solutions that protect  and restore ecosystems around the world. low-carbon design to reduce the carbon footprint of our products,  we’re increasing efficiency and transitioning  to materials from recycled sources and those  made using low-carbon energy. in  , we  continued to improve the carbon efficiency of  the integrated circuits we use in our products  — components we’ve prioritized because they  are carbon-intensive. for example, switching  to the apple m  chip for the  -inch macbook  pro reduced the energy needed to manufacture  and use the device, driving down the product’s  carbon footprint by over   percent. we’ve continued to expand our use of    percent recycled aluminum in the enclosures  of a number of products. all ipad models in our  lineup now use   percent recycled aluminum  in their enclosures — joining apple watch  series  , apple watch se, macbook air, mac  mini, and the  -inch and  -inch macbook pro  devices. for products released in   that had  enclosures made with primary aluminum, we energy efficiency we’re focused on using less energy across  our operations, beginning with how we design,  operate, and maintain our facilities. and we  continue these same efforts into our supply  chain, which benefits the communities where  our suppliers operate. drawing less energy from  electrical grids — many of which still rely heavily  on fossil fuels — helps reduce local air pollution  and improve air quality for nearby communities. the emissions from manufacturing our products  account for about   percent of apple’s gross  carbon footprint. we launched our supplier energy  efficiency program in   with the goal of helping  suppliers optimize their facilities and operations  to use as little energy as possible. we provide  guidance designed to help suppliers uncover  opportunities for energy efficiency. suppliers in  our supplier energy efficiency program avoided  more than  , ,  annualized metric tons of  supply chain carbon emissions in fiscal

electricity rather than  fossil fuels — for a lower carbon impact. these  changes alone have decreased the carbon  emissions associated with our use of aluminum  by   percent since  . product energy use accounts for   percent   of our gross carbon footprint — and has an  impact on the individual energy use of each   of our customers. by addressing this in the  earliest phases of design, we’ve cut the product  energy use across all major product lines by  more than   percent since   through  energy efficiency improvements.  in fiscal  year  , over   percent of apple’s eligible  products, by revenue, received an energy  star rating for superior energy efficiency.    and over   percent of apple’s eligible  products, by revenue, met the requirements   for epeat registration.  appendix

manufacturing partners in    countries have committed to   percent  renewable energy for apple production. over   percent of companies on apple’s  supplier list — those suppliers that make  up   percent of apple’s direct spend for  materials, manufacturing, and assembly of  our products worldwide — have committed to    percent renewable electricity. in addition,  many other smaller suppliers have also made  these commitments.direct emissions abatement to address the non-electricity emissions  associated with our materials and  manufacturing processes, we seek  technological solutions through emissions  abatement or switching to low-carbon fuel  options. for example, we partnered with  aluminum companies and the governments  of canada and quebec to help fund research  and development for elysis, a technology that  eliminates direct greenhouse gas emissions  from aluminum smelting. many components essential to products like  ours, including integrated circuit chips and  display panels, currently rely on manufacturing  processes that use fluorinated gases, which  have high global warming potential. we’re  partnering closely with key manufacturers  to prevent these gases from being  released into the atmosphere by optimizing  manufacturing processes and deploying  abatement technologies. to address emissions from shipping products  to our customers, we’re shifting whenever  possible toward less carbon-intensive shipping  modes, such as rail and ocean. and we’re  seeking out technical innovations, including  alternative fuels and electric vehicles. in fiscal  year  , apple avoided  ,  metric tons  of co  e by shifting the mode of transport and  reducing product weight through the removal   of the power adapter from the box of  iphone devices. providing access to clean energy in south africa  even a few years ago, not everyone in one community in south africa had electricity   at home. many people had been using battery-powered lanterns because upfront costs  and other challenges put connecting to the grid out of reach. as we worked with our  partners to identify new renewable energy projects for our power for impact program,   we saw exciting potential in this community.  our partner on the ground, dc go, a solar energy provider based in johannesburg,   got to work meeting members of the community and learning more about their needs.  ultimately, dc go developed a pay-as-you-go model that brought solar energy to    homes that previously lacked access. this was possible only because of the way they   built relationships with community members and worked with apple to price the solution   in line with what people were already spending on batteries for their lanterns. in addition, dc go hired and trained local people for jobs in sales, maintenance,   and other roles that not only created local jobs but also helped to make sure the project   — and the community’s access to electricity — would be sustainable over time.   this is just one example of how the power for impact program is working to benefit  communities, our company, and the environment at the same time. learn more   on pages   and   of our environmental

nature-based  carbon removal projects also offer important  ecological and social benefits, such as preserving  biodiversity and enhancing the resilience of  ecosystems, while often providing economic  development opportunities for local communities. we partnered with conservation international  and goldman sachs to launch the innovative  restore fund, which seeks to blend responsible  forestry practices with carbon removal: we’re  working with forestry managers to create  sustainably managed forests that optimize for  both carbon and wood production, creating  revenue from timber, and generating high- quality carbon credits. apple will invest up to  $  million in projects that aim to remove  carbon from the atmosphere and store it, all  while meeting clear social and environmental  impact criteria and offering a financial return.   in its pilot phase, the restore fund has a goal   of removing at least   million metric tons of  carbon dioxide per year.for more information on our efforts to combat  climate change and reach our   carbon  neutral goal, read our   environmental  progress report .climate scenario analysis  in  , we conducted a climate scenario analysis to help us better understand the potential physical and  transition effects of climate change. to align with the task force on climate-related financial disclosures  (tcfd) recommendations, we considered a range of future scenarios, including a scenario below  °c.  and we assessed geographies around the world to capture both corporate and supplier activities. the  analysis highlighted how our renewable energy program and carbon neutrality goals could contribute to our  corporate resiliency. it also provided environmental data that we considered in developing business strategies,  including considerations around supply chain diversification, as well as safeguarding our global assets. we’re committed to managing regulatory, reputational, and market risks related to climate change.   for more information

governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     resources  natural resources make our work possible —  and we take responsibility for how we source,  use, and recycle the materials we rely on to  create our products. as a starting point, this  means sourcing responsibly, minimizing our  freshwater use, and eliminating waste across  our operations and those of our suppliers.  and we’re also seeking to redefine the overall  resource footprint of our products. our goal is   to one day make products using only responsibly  sourced recycled and renewable materials. within resources, we focus on three main   areas of impact: • materials:  transitioning to only recycled  or renewable materials in our products  and packaging, and maximizing material  efficiency, product longevity, and recovery. • water:  reducing water impacts in the  manufacturing of our products, use of our  services, and operation of our facilities.   at the same time, transitioning to alternative  sources, improving the quality of water  we discharge, and protecting shared  water resources. • zero waste: minimizing overall waste  generated and eliminating waste sent to  landfill from our manufacturing supply chain  as well as corporate offices, data centers,   and retail stores.materials we aim to make the best use of the materials we  rely on to make our products. that’s why we’re  focusing on three different levers to reduce  our footprint and achieve circularity: sourcing  and efficiency; product longevity; and product  end-of-life. sourcing and efficiency last year, we made progress across materials —  from expanding our use of recycled rare earth  elements to designing cameras with recycled  gold. in september, we introduced iphone  ,  with more certified recycled materials than any  previous version of iphone. we also introduced    percent recycled aluminum enclosures on  every single model in the ipad lineup.welcoming the first class of the impact accelerator  last year, we welcomed the first class to our impact accelerator, a program for black- ,hispanic/latinx-, and indigenous-owned businesses headquartered in the united states  that share our focus on innovation and our commitment to the environment. part of apple’s  racial equity and justice initiative (see page   ), the accelerator aims to help combat  systemic barriers to opportunity, while also advancing innovative solutions for communities  most impacted by climate change.  we selected our first class of   businesses on the cutting edge of green technology and  clean energy to begin the program in august  . the three-month program included live  virtual sessions, online courses on supply chain management, supplier diversity, financial  and legal subjects, as well as one-on-one mentorship with an apple expert on topics from  renewable energy to responsible sourcing. the goal of the impact accelerator is to better position the participating companies for  growth, to improve their abilities to take on larger contracts, and to expand their customer  base — all while fostering their environmental commitment. for example, last october we  announced that we will be working with the oceti sakowin power authority, formed by six  sioux tribes to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources, on a project to create   a wind power development in the midwest. and following the success of this year’s class,  our efforts continue. this spring, applications opened for the next class to join our   impact accelerator. for apple’s inaugural impact accelerator, leaders from   companies participated   in a three-month virtual program with customized training and access to apple   expert mentors.  % in fiscal year  ,

aluminum in the  enclosure. these and other innovations helped  us increase our use of recycled or renewable  content to   percent of all the material shipped  in products in fiscal year  . product longevity we want to make the most of the materials we  use through designing long-lasting products.  we are designing durable hardware, leveraging  software updates to extend functionality,  expanding access to repair services,  refurbishing devices for their next user, and  reusing parts that still have more to give. read  more on caring for customers on page   . product end-of-life  by effectively recovering the materials in our  products, we enable the circular supply chains  that make the best use of finite resources.  through our work in this area, we’re reducing  the need to mine new materials and the  amount of energy needed to manufacture new  products, ultimately driving down emissions  and conserving resources. in   percent of the countries where we  sell products, we continue to provide and  participate in product take-back and recycling  collection programs. with the help of  customer and employee participation across  recycling programs, we directed more than   ,  metric tons of e-waste to recycling  globally in fiscal year  . we’ve also continued to innovate on  disassembly technologies. daisy, the robot we  designed to disassemble iphone devices, has  now been joined by dave, which dismantles  taptic engines from iphone to enable the  recovery of materials like rare earth elements,  tungsten, and steel, and taz, designed to  recycle modules containing rare earth magnets.  at our material recovery lab we’re working  on developing better, more efficient means of  disassembling products that maximize material  recovery, while minimizing waste.water stewardship we’re committed to managing the resources   we share with the communities where we and  our suppliers operate. our efforts to address  the water footprint of our corporate sites and   of our suppliers’ sites focus on: • using water efficiently • expanding the use of alternative water  sources, including onsite reuse • discharging water responsibly • enhancing our water stewardship to keep  watersheds healthy for all who rely on them in fiscal year  , our facilities used about   .  billion gallons of water. we saved   million  gallons of freshwater this fiscal year due to  efficiency projects implemented since   .   last year, alternative water sources accounted  for   percent of our total corporate water usage  — primarily from recycled water sources.  our supply chain accounts for   percent of  our total water footprint, based on our detailed  water inventory. that’s why we partner closely  with our suppliers through our clean water  program. the more than   participating  supplier sites increased their average reuse  rate to   percent and saved our suppliers   .  billion gallons of freshwater in fiscal year    — for a total of  .  billion gallons of  water savings since the program’s launch  in  . innovating packaging to reduce our footprint we’ve made significant progress toward eliminating all plastics from our packaging by  .  this past year, plastics accounted for only   percent of our packaging. since  , we’ve  dedicated our efforts to replacing large plastic trays, wraps, and foam cushioning with fiber  alternatives that have higher recovery rates and reduced environmental footprints.  this year, the iphone   and iphone   pro were the first iphone models to be shipped  without any plastic packaging components.  and we replaced plastic foam with a fiber  alternative to protect the  -inch imac during shipping. for the  -inch imac, using corrugated fiber rather than foam for shock absorption   allowed us to reduce plastic by   percent. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     smarter chemistry the well-being of our employees, customers,  people in our

comprehensive  picture of chemicals across our supply chain,  to insist on rigorous chemical management  processes, to promote adoption of safer  chemical alternatives, and to innovate through  design smarter approaches to making our  products. using safer chemistry in our  products also enables recycling and material  recovery, so that our products can be the raw  materials for the next generation.the pillars of our smarter chemistry  strategy are: mapping and engagement:  engage our  supply chain partners to comprehensively  identify the chemicals in the materials used   to make our products, allowing us to drive  change that goes beyond what is required   for regulatory compliance. assessment and management:  assess the  potential human health and environmental risks  of chemicals to evaluate compliance with our  requirements and inform product design. innovation:  drive the development and use   of innovative materials that enable the creation  of groundbreaking products and also support  industrywide change. mapping and engagement our full material disclosure (fmd) program  maps the chemicals used in our products —  an effort that includes tens of thousands of  parts and assemblies. then we look at how  our products are manufactured. our chemical  safety disclosure (csd) program engages with  supply chain partners to get the most recent  information on which materials are in use.   this information includes the volume of  materials being consumed and how they’re  being applied, stored, and handled — as well   as the steps being taken to protect employees. more than   supplier facilities have shared  their chemical inventories as well as storage and  safety protocols as part of our csd program.  through this process, we’ve identified more

more than  ,   hours participating in all apple university  courses combined. educational assistance program:  our  educational assistance program offers tuition  reimbursement for team members to continue  their education. apple mentorship program: our new  mentorship program creates opportunities for  apple employees of all backgrounds to learn  from one another and grow their careers at  apple. after successful pilot programs in the u.s. and the uk, we’re continuing to expand the  program globally, pairing a greater number of  experienced apple mentors with future leaders  from across the company. retail-specific training: through onboarding  training, new apple retail employees learn  the fundamental knowledge and skills that  will support their success at apple. ongoing  training opportunities cover apple culture  and values, products and services, systems,  processes, and customer engagement skills. across apple, our managers and leaders help our team members to learn, improve,   and do the best work of their lives.  career experience:  career experiences  enable temporary, hands-on development  opportunities for apple store, service, and  support team members by creating short- term rotations in technical, operations, and  corporate functions across apple. participants  build new skills, explore an aspirational role  up close, and gain in-role experience, while  host teams benefit from the unique customer- facing perspectives, talents, and passions of  participants. the program is currently available  in   locations in every geographic region, with  more countries being added each year, and   % of apple’s lines of business participate. ,   training hours in apple university  in fy   appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople

experience. over a two-year period,  participants rotate through multiple teams to  gain a breadth of experience and exposure to  various projects to help discover their strengths  and passion. upon successful completion of  the program, participants will often transition  into a non-rotating role within apple. our  services, finance, operations, and ai/ml  functions all offer these types of programs. performance reviews  our annual performance review process  offers team members the opportunity to  have meaningful conversations with their  managers about their performance, growth, and  development. across apple, employees receive  an annual performance review, and retail team  members are supported by monthly performance  conversations to align on their progress. performance reviews focus on three categories:  teamwork, innovation, and results, and they  include a self-assessment and feedback from  peers and the team member’s manager. the  performance review is also a chance to reflect  on the contribution each person makes to  apple’s long-standing commitment to inclusion  and diversity. benefits we recognize that our people thrive when  they have the resources to meet their needs  and the time and support to succeed in their  professional and personal lives. we provide  a host of benefits for corporate and retail  employees to help our teams live healthier, more  fulfilled, and happier lives at work and beyond.   we regularly review and update the benefits that  we offer in order to respond to our employees’  changing needs. for example, we recently  expanded family care services and mental health  benefits, including   free counseling sessions  through our employee assistance program, to  help employees care for themselves and their  loved ones through the pandemic. and in the  u.s., we now offer part-time team members  new vacation and sick leave days, new parent  leave, gradual return to work, paid family  care, and emergency backup care, and in  ,  we enhanced sick leave benefits and a new  accelerated vacation accrual schedule for full-time  employees in our u.s. apple store locations. physical and mental well-being apple provides employees with a wide variety   of health-related benefits, including: • physical and mental health coverage that also  extends to spouses and domestic partners • virtual and onsite wellness visits for employees  and eligible dependents • free, confidential counseling for employees  and their dependents   • comprehensive reproductive health services   • expert second opinion resources to help  employees and their family members make  informed healthcare decisions  every year, our performance review process helps team members have meaningful   conversations with their managers. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     • a comprehensive mental health and   well-being hub where employees can find  events, apps,

of our employees and  their families. they are transgender inclusive,  where legally and plan allowed, and support  routine care, therapies, and other medically  necessary surgeries.  life and family  apple also provides a number of benefits to  support our employees in their personal and  family life, including:  • retirement programs to help employees with  their future financial needs, such as  (k)  matching contributions in the u.s. and local  retirement plans for employees outside of   the u.s.  • referrals and resources for childcare, which  includes backup care in the u.s., as well  as before- and after-school programs,  programs for children with special needs,  and more  • consultations and referrals to support  employees caring for an elderly  family member  • adoption, surrogacy, and fertility services  • financial coaching services  • tuition reimbursement  • legal services for adoption, child support,  housing, wills, identity theft, and more  coming back to work after the arrival of a child  can be a big adjustment for employees, so to smooth the transition period following the arrival  of a new family member, our gradual return- to-work program allows employees to choose  to return half-time at full pay for four weeks —  whether they’re welcoming a child through birth,  adoption, or other covered means. time away  taking the time to recharge is an important part  of employee health and well-being. we provide  a wide variety of time-away options for our  employees, including:  • vacation •  paid sick time and medical leave for serious  health conditions   • pregnancy leave and new parent leave   • leave for bereavement or to care for a sick  family member  • time off for voting, jury duty, and other  civil obligations  • company holidays throughout the year  product discounts  apple’s employee purchase plan offers special  pricing on most apple products. we offer  substantial discounts on hardware, software,  and accessories for employees, families, and  friends — as well as an additional credit that can  be used to purchase a mac, ipad, or unlocked  iphone once every two years.  compensation  we believe that our compensation should not  only be highly competitive across all types of  roles, levels, and talent markets; it should be equitable and enable all team members to share  in the company’s success as shareholders  of apple. we’re committed to being a leader in pay  equity, providing all employees with annual  opportunities for stock ownership in the  company, and offering highly competitive  pay that’s in the top tier of each local market.  and we hold our leaders accountable by  incorporating apple values and key community  initiatives into our executive short-term  incentive plan.  competitive pay  apple is committed to remaining a market  leader in compensation through our highly  competitive and equitable programs. in  addition to our stock program and wide range  of benefits we provide, we regularly review our  competitive position to establish our leading  starting pay rates in each local market. apple stock ownership  in  , we introduced our stock ownership  program, which was designed to reach  employees who were not previously eligible for  restricted stock unit (rsu) awards, including  all of our retail and applecare teams. by the  end of  , over $ .  billion of rsu grants will  have been awarded under this program, and  the shares underlying the rsus today would  have an estimated value of over $  billion  (based on a share price of $ .  as of june   ,  ). apple is one of the few companies  in the s&p  , and the largest technology  company, in which employees at all levels are  eligible for rsu grants on an annual basis. in   ,  ,  employees were eligible for  rsu grants and our compensation committee  approved grants for  % of those eligible. in most countries, employees also get discounts  when purchasing apple stock by participating  in the employee stock purchase plan (espp).  currently,   percent of eligible employees  participate in the espp. esg modifier beginning in  , the compensation  committee incorporated the esg modifier  into the executive annual cash incentive  program. the esg modifier is based on a  holistic evaluation by the compensation  committee of key accomplishments and  actions taken during the year to advance  our apple values: accessibility, education,  environment, inclusion and diversity, privacy,  and supplier responsibility, and key community  initiatives which were chosen because they  represent long-standing, business-relevant  environmental, social, and governance  principles that reflect apple’s commitment to  promoting values-driven leadership. pay equity  since  , apple has achieved and maintained  gender pay equity for our employees worldwide.  in the u.s., we’ve also achieved pay equity with  respect to race and ethnicity — as well as pay  equity at the intersections of race and ethnicity  with gender.* in addition to our pay equity commitment,  our inclusion and diversity program (see  page   ) supports growth, development,  and engagement for team members of  all backgrounds. we have a number of practices in place  to support our commitment to pay  equity, including:  * pay equity at the intersections of race and ethnicity  with gender was achieved in  . appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     we encourage open and honest communication among team members, managers, and leadership as we seek to  build a better work environment for all. another way team members can let us know  how apple is doing is to participate in surveys  that we conduct regularly. these survey results  are a great way for us to learn about what’s  going well and how we can do better in areas  like career development, manager performance,  and inclusivity, and teams are encouraged to  create action plans based on the survey results. we conduct annual surveys for all apple store  and applecare team members to listen to their  views on topics like leadership, management,  career development, performance, values,  culture, and work environment. and leaders  from each organization use the survey insights  to take steps to better support team members  where they need it.  over the last two years in particular, we focused  on listening to apple store and applecare  employees as they were interacting most  directly with customers during the pandemic  and experiencing rapid change in how they  worked to support those customers. for our  early   surveys,   percent of apple store  team members and   percent of applecare   team members participated.annual compensation planning:  during our  annual compensation planning process, the  people team uses analytics to assess promotion  rates, performance ratings distribution, and pay  metrics for women compared to men and, in the  u.s., for underrepresented groups compared   to non-underrepresented groups. global compensation history policy:  we  don’t ask candidates for salary history during  the recruiting process, which has been our  policy globally since  . our recruiters  develop offers of employment based on the  compensation of current apple employees in  similar roles using a tool developed specifically  for this purpose.  engagement at apple, we believe that open and honest  communication among team members,  managers, and leaders helps create an open,  collaborative work environment where everyone  can contribute, grow, and succeed. across all our teams, we’re always building on  our long-standing commitment to creating an  environment where people at every level of the  company feel connected and supported. our  goal is to listen and learn — and to use those  lessons to build an even better workplace for all.  if team members have questions, feedback,  or concerns, they’re encouraged to share  them with their manager. if a team member is  ever uncomfortable raising a particular issue  with their manager, they can discuss it with  any manager at apple, their people business  partner, people support, or they can contact  the business conduct team. pay equity at apple our pay equity review is global and covers     percent of our employees. we consider  total compensation, including base salary,  bonus, and stock.  :   gender pay equity globally  :   pay equity in the u.s. by race  and ethnicity  :  gender pay equity in every country  :   pay equity in the u.s. at   the intersections of race   and

compensation on the basis of gender and, in  the u.s., on the basis of race and ethnicity and  at the intersections with gender. job assessments:  apple’s dedicated  compensation team regularly conducts  comprehensive job title reviews to ensure that  employees are in the correct job title, which is  an important factor in determining pay. we also  continuously analyze market data to ensure  that compensation guidelines for all roles  remain competitive. empowering employees   to support the causes they   care about  our employee giving program provides  opportunities for employees to contribute  to the causes they care deeply about with  the support of apple. from volunteering to  donations to smaller individual actions, apple  is committed to giving, hand in hand with our  team members. read more on page   .apple has a no-retaliation policy. retaliation  against anyone who comes forward with a  concern or participates in an investigation is  grounds for termination. we respect each team  member’s right to form or join (or refrain from  joining) organizations of their choice in a lawful  manner without discrimination, retaliation,  or harassment. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     workplace practices  and policies  apple’s culture is built on treating everyone with  dignity and respect, and this focus shapes how our colleagues engage with one another and with our customers and partners around the world. we’re also committed to respecting our team members’ rights as set out in our human rights  policy . equal employment opportunity  apple is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity.  we take steps to provide equal opportunity for all applicants and employees, without regard to race, color, ancestry, national origin, caste, religion, creed, age (over  ), mental and physical disability, sex, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, military or protected veteran status, an

designed to promote  fairness and impartiality, in line with our values  and policies. the reviewer will consider any   new i nformation t hat i ndicates t he decision   may not have been in accordance with our  policies a nd g uidelines.  non-employees   and temporary workers in addition to our full-time employees,  temporary workers and vendor services play an  important role on our team. our temporary  workers generally p erform s imilar w ork as our  full-time employees, as they are intended to  augment t he apple employee  workforce  under   a short t o mid -term a ssignment. a pproximately   percent of our u.s. corporate workforce  were temporary workers as of october  . temporary workers have the same opportunity to be considered as all other applicants to any apple job posting whether that opportunity is a conversion of their current role or a role they found on our job site. and in our retail business, we have a strong record of hiring temporary workers as full- and part-time employees.  our outsourced services with workers provided  via vendors generally perform work that can be different from that performed by our permanent employees. this workforce is intended to support business needs where specific skills are required and the vendors have the ability  to scale with our varied business needs. pay and benefits: for vendor services, pay  rates are managed by the vendor. various benefits, including but not limited to healthcare, are offered to these workers through their employer or staffing agencies. vendors are also accountable to apple’s supplier code of conduct, which requires that our staffing agencies are compliant with all current local and national legislation and employment laws, including wage and benefits requirements, for their employees (see page    or people and  environment in our supply  chain ). raising concerns:  in many cases there are  multiple avenues for non-apple workers to report problems anonymously, including internal processes with their employer and the apple business conduct helpline (see page   ). performance:  vendor performance is  reviewed and evaluated by the vendor management based on feedback sometimes received from apple managers, procurement, and/or supplier responsibility. reporting a concern  at apple we believe strongly in a culture of open communication, mutual respect, and high  ethical standards — and we strive to do the right thing. it can be stressful if something at apple has a negative effect on well-being, violates an apple policy, or interferes with someone’s ability to do their best work. there are several ways team members can report a concern: managers:  talking to a manager is a good place to start. a large part of their responsibility  is to support their team members. if a team member is not comfortable bringing a concern  to their manager, they can discuss it with any manager at apple. people support:  this dedicated team specializes in supporting apple team members with  work-related topics. they can answer questions, clarify a policy, or suggest resources or  options to help resolve a problem.   business conduct:  team members can contact the business conduct team via phone,  email, or a third party. they will review the concern and share it with the appropriate internal  partners. read more on page   . people business partner:  team members can discuss the issue with their people  business partner (pbp), particularly if it’s related to your team or organization. team members are encouraged to raise their concerns in the way they feel most  comfortable, internally or externally. in addition to the options above, they may also contact any of the government agencies or other external organizations that address employee and workplace concerns. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     protecting each other’s health at every stage of the pandemic, our first  priority has always been the health of our  teams, customers, and communities. that  meant being one of the first companies to  close our offices and retail stores, and finding  innovative ways to connect with colleagues and  customers virtually. since  , we’ve continued our efforts and  programs to support our people. we adopted  cdc recommendations around up-to-date  vaccinations, including booster doses. apple  also continued to pay our teams during  temporary store and office closures, expanded  our paid leave policies, and enhanced our  policies and procedures for a safe work  environment — both in the office and in-store.to keep our teams informed, we deployed  comprehensive resources with up-to-date  covid-  information, including a dedicated  platform for teams returning to the office.  covid-  case support, implemented for  all team members, included return-to-work  guidance and contact tracing, with the utmost  regard for employee privacy. we continue to  offer special sick leave for employees with  possible covid-  symptoms, as well as  comprehensive health coverage. to continue to manage our response going  forward, we created a dedicated pandemic  response team in   in addition to the  cross-functional team that has been supporting  and guiding our covid response. the new  response team will support future pandemic  planning and response.innovating to support our customers despite all of the pandemic’s challenges, we  brought our hardware, software, and services  into customers’ hands, helping them stay  informed, connected, and entertained. we also tailored our services to promote easy  access to trusted information on covid- :  launching a dedicated section on apple news;  prioritizing visibility of essential services  locations — including covid-  testing and  vaccination locations — on apple maps;  offering a curated collection of telehealth apps  on the app store; and leveraging siri to provide  the latest covid-  guidance. to meet the extraordinary challenges of  virtual education, we delivered new content  and services for students, parents, and  teachers to foster creativity and learning  in a digital environment. we worked with  mobile carriers and school administrators  to deliver ipad devices with cellular support  for students in need. with our apple card  customer assistance program, we also offered  customers the option to skip their monthly  payments without incurring interest.  across many of our apple store locations,  we were able to serve our customers’  needs through contactless pickup, express  storefronts, and new online support. our  response to covid-  is still ongoing, and  we’re committed to implementing health  protocols and adjusting store operations as  required based on available data and guidance  from health officials.apple’s  covid-   response the health of our teams, customers, and communities continues to be our first priority. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     supporting people in our supply chain we are continuing to work together with our  suppliers to help them ensure that every  necessary precaution is taken to keep people  safe at work. in  , we introduced an  enhancement to our code and standards  specifically addressing infectious disease  preparedness and response (idpr). idpr  contains a set of new requirements resulting  from our learnings during the pandemic, which  will help our suppliers better prepare for and  be ready to respond to an infectious disease  outbreak at their facility. as part of the rollout  of idpr in fiscal year  , we conducted  more than   onsite and remote specialized  assessments to verify suppliers’ compliance  with covid-  control protocols in order to  drive improvement when necessary. we also continue to assess any existing gaps  at supplier facilities, and identify opportunities  to work with those in higher-risk areas to  help make their facilities safer. this includes  working with third-party suppliers to redesign  and reconfigure factory floor plans where  necessary, implementing flexible working hours  to maximize interpersonal space, implementing  enhanced deep cleaning protocols, and  deploying masks and sanitizers. in fiscal year   , we also encouraged our suppliers’  employees to get vaccinated and boosted  where available. we also partnered with ngos to help further  support supplier employees, as well as those  working deeper in our supply chain, particularly  those from vulnerable groups. we worked with  the international organization for migration  (iom) — the world’s leading organization  providing services to migrant workers — to  provide support to migrant workers impacted by the pandemic. with support from apple,  our long-time partner pact, an international  development organization, prepared and  coordinated activities to prevent the spread of  covid-  in several mining communities in the  democratic republic of the congo (drc). the  initiative has reached more than  ,  people  through individual and group dialogues on  covid-  prevention since the program began  in december  . giving back to our communities apple’s company-wide response to the  covid-  pandemic involved teams across  the business, including product design,  engineering, operations, packaging teams,  suppliers, and more. at the beginning of the  pandemic, when personal protective equipment  was in short supply, we sourced through our  supply chain and donated more than   million  masks for healthcare workers worldwide.  we also launched a company-wide effort to  produce and ship over   million face shields.  these face shields were delivered to sites  around the world, from new york presbyterian  hospital in the u.s. to the ministry of health  in zambia.  additionally, we have also donated over  $  million to the world health organization’s  covid-  solidarity response fund. we also  matched employee donations two-to-one to  support covid-  response efforts worldwide.  we awarded $  million from our advanced  manufacturing fund to copan diagnostics,  a market leader in sample collection kits,  that rapidly accelerated their ability to supply  sample collection kits to hospitals in the u.s.  for covid-  testing. and our partnership  with product (red) also supported covid-   response (see page   ). collaboration with our suppliers helps them make sure they’re taking every necessary  precaution to keep people safe at work. in partnership with the white house  coronavirus task force and the cdc, we  released an app and a website that guided  americans through a series of questions about  their health and exposure to determine if they  should seek care for covid-  symptoms,  providing cdc recommendations on next  steps, including guidance on social distancing  and self -isolating, how to closely monitor symptoms, recommendations on testing,  and when to contact a medical provider.  and we collaborated with google to create a  new exposure notification system for global  governments and health agencies, with user  privacy and security central to its design, to  help fight the pandemic. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     health and safety at apple  we’re dedicated to protecting our team  members and our customers everywhere  we operate — a responsibility covid-  has  brought into even greater focus. at every  stage of the pandemic, we’ve made decisions  based on the latest local data and public health  guidance, and we share lessons across our  environment, health, and safety (ehs) teams  globally so we can continuously improve our  safety programs.  protecting our people  we’re always working hard to make sure our  workers are safe no matter where they are  when they’re conducting business for apple.  we abide by ehs requirements in every country  where we operate and are dedicated to doing  everything we can to support the safety and  well-being of our global teams.  managing work-related hazards and risks  to help ensure the safety of our workers and  customers, we put procedures in place to  identify workplace risks and mitigate possible  hazards. we support and protect employees  in lower hazard spaces, and we put risk- specific programs in place for those working  in higher hazard environments, including safe  systems of work, chemical management,  laser safety, equipment and machinery safety,  hazardous materials management, and  electrical safety. employees can request to  have their workspaces individually inspected  to review hazards and controls, including  ergonomics evaluations. apple implements a hierarchy of control  for significant risks, which centers on  elimination, substitution, engineering controls,  administrative controls, and personal protective  equipment (ppe). as one example, apple ehs regularly assesses  hazards at our research labs based on their  chemical, equipment, laser, and other hazards.  approximately   percent of our labs are  considered “complex,” meaning that they  contain high-hazard processes and equipment.  these assessments help teams understand  which ehs programs and controls must be  put in place to mitigate risks. in  , apple  completed hazard assessments in over    research labs globally. our ehs teams identify and provide team  members with appropriate ppe for specific  hazards. this ppe is provided at no cost and  with training on correct use. for example,  our hearing conservation programs include  evaluation and control of occupational  exposures to noise, and hearing protection is  available for processes, areas, and tasks with  potential high noise exposures. additionally,  ehs conducts mandatory health checks for  employees where they’re needed. we invest in new technologies as we continue  to manage potential risks across our operations,  including our apple-owned manufacturing  sites. our standards, programs, trainings,  procedures, and other safeguards are managed  by trained ehs professionals, and where  required, we also translate ehs procedures into  local languages for our team members. risks identified from incidents, injuries, and  non-routine events are addressed expeditiously  to identify and implement appropriate  corrective and preventative actions, and we  integrate our learnings into future program  development and training. lessons learned  are routinely communicated across apple’s  ehs team and potentially affected operations,  and they are used to inform updates to existing  policies and procedures. employees and managers can report incidents,  near-misses, and observations — including  newly identified hazards and risks—through  an internal ios app. incident responses are  addressed by apple’s ehs team through a  consistent process that connects employees  with care and support, while identifying  corrective actions where appropriate to prevent  future occurrences.  waste management apple is committed to minimizing resource  use and the associated generation of non- hazardous or hazardous waste. where  possible, apple implements a waste hierarchy  of prevention, waste reduction at the source,  reuse of materials, recycling, energy recovery,  and landfilling as a last resort. we maintain our commitment to the safe and  responsible management of hazardous waste,  both onsite and offsite. any facility that does  not meet our requirements is replaced by  another approved waste management facility. we made progress in   at sites around  the world:u.s.:  thirteen of the treatment, storage, and  disposal facilities (tsdfs) we utilize in the u.s.  were audited in   to confirm that the waste  is treated, recycled, or incinerated within the  governing safety standards for health and the  environment. eight disposal facility reviews  were completed by vendors under apple  management, and we reviewed five other sites  via third-party audit reports. at one of our major  research labs in santa clara valley, the empty  container management program resulted in a    percent reduction of lab debris for hazardous  waste streams. united kingdom:  through an internal initiative  to further strengthen waste management,  product site-specific waste initiatives  achieved a   percent diversion from landfill  and a  .  tonnes of waste/ , both  exceeding requirements. ireland:  the cork campus is ecvp   zero  waste to landfill certified annually and has had  no material landfilled in the past five years. ergonomics in  , we continued to support our global  team members working from home office,  apple office, and non-office settings.  the apple ergonomics program is heavily  focused on preventative measures to reduce  the risk of work-related musculoskeletal  disorders (wmsds). this includes ergonomics  training sessions for our team members and  providing input into the purchase or design  of work equipment, systems, and facilities to  ensure that they meet ergonomic standards to  provide the best levels of efficiency, comfort,  health, and safety for anyone using them. our  appendix governance communities suppliers customers our p eople environment introduction apple’s   esg report     ergonomics trainings and self-assessment  support are aimed at creating an awareness  of ergonomic risk factors for wmsds, how to  prevent them, and how to proactively request  for adjustments to workstations.  we completed over  ,  individual support  requests for our team members working from  home, along with those who returned to apple  offices and apple store locations. support  included tailored guidance and feedback,  equipment recommendations, and  :  virtual  or in-person assessments. in addition, over    employees participated in various  training sessions.  our industrial, warehouse, and other non- office operations teams were supported with  approximately   ergonomic risk assessments  and   lab screenings. the assessments  evaluated risk factors such as repetition,  force, posture, and duration, while reviewing  the interaction of the team member with  new machines, equipment, work processes,  and workspaces. emergency preparedness and response  beyond covid- , we supported the response  to dozens of crisis events in  , including  fires, severe weather, and civil unrest. our  responses focused on the safety of our  employees and business continuity. we  activated   crisis management teams (cmts)  to manage the most severe events, and    additional incidents were supported without  full cmts.all team members can sign up for apple’s  emergency alert system, enabling them to be  notified of local emergencies and to indicate  whether they are safe or need help. disaster  supplies are available at our facilities. all apple  campuses with over   employees have  facility response and recovery plans, which  provide a comprehensive approach to the safety  and support of our employees while minimizing  business interruption. site-specific emergency  response plans have been implemented  globally. these plans are communicated to all  employees, and trainings and drills are held at  least annually. and our employees are trained  in emergency response, allowing them to react  quickly while supporting the safety of our team  members and customers.  in  , we completed over   emergency  response drills, which were supported by    trained emergency response team  (ert) members. we expect to increase the  frequency of these drills, depending on  covid-  restrictions.  with the care and support of our employees  and customers in mind, we deployed automatic  external defibrillator (aed) stations across  our global retail stores in  . and to ensure  that our team members could effectively use  this new tool, we provided aed training for our  team members. all campuses and key sites have disaster supplies  to match localized risks. as apple’s footprint  grows, sites are evaluated and supplies are  added as needed. as one example, in  , we  launched earthquake preparedness campaigns  for employees across the western united states  and japan. we conducted outreach to provide  employees with information, tools, and resources,  and we held drills in some offices. we’re always working hard to make sure our workers are safe no matter where they are when  they’re conducting business for apple.  appendix

list smelter and refiner list   efforts to combat human   trafficking and slaveryour approach our commitment to people and the planet  extends across our supply chain — from  manufacturing to services, and to the many  places where our suppliers operate. we work  closely with our suppliers to uphold the highest  standards so that the people in our supply  chain are safe and treated with respect, and  the environment is protected everywhere that  apple products are made. apple’s work in this space is led by apple  senior management. sabih khan is apple’s  senior vice president of operations, reporting  to coo jeff williams. sabih is in charge of  apple’s global supply chain, product quality,  and overseeing planning, procurement,  manufacturing, logistics, and product

suppliers to propel green manufacturing, help  conserve resources, and protect the planet. holding ourselves and our suppliers   to the highest standards  as described on page   , our human rights  policy  outlines how we treat everyone, including  our customers, employees, business partners,  and people at every level of our supply chain.  we take a very broad view of our supply  chain (see diagram on page   ) — and the  responsibility that comes with it. we consider  our supply chain to include everything that  goes into designing, building, delivering,  supporting, and recycling of apple products,  as well as our retail stores and all of the services  and operations that are part of our supply  chain ecosystem. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people

been prevented from entering  our supply chain for being unable or unwilling to  meet our code and standards. once new suppliers are awarded apple  business, we begin the process of helping them  quickly get up to speed on our requirements  through our supplier onboarding process.   in  , we expanded our onboarding process  to engage new suppliers at an even earlier  stage in their working

the planet beyond the reach of our business and  supply chain. supplier engagement   and accountability we take a broad, comprehensive approach  to engaging with our suppliers to confirm that  our standards are met. one of the tools that  we employ are assessments. assessments,  also known as audits, are one of several  methods we use to measure compliance  with our requirements. these independent,  third-party assessments, which take place  onsite at supplier facilities, provide a snapshot  of a supplier’s performance. however, when  combined with regular engagement with  supplier teams, mandated reporting, and  listening directly to hundreds of thousands  of supplier employees about their workplace  experiences, our rigorous supplier assessments  provide a clear measure of their performance in  upholding our code and standards. in the   reporting period,   assessments  were conducted in   countries. this included    code of conduct assessments and    smelter and refiner assessments.  since  ,  apple-managed assessments have covered    percent of our direct manufacturing spend. the apple supply chain   million+  people thousands of businesses and facilities  countries our people and environment in our supply  chain report  (page  ) provides a detailed  overview of progress in our supply chain,  including efforts to identify, mitigate, prevent,  and remedy human rights risks as outlined by  the business and human rights due diligence  process set forth in the ungps. we work closely with many experts across  apple — from product and services designers  to facility managers — to evaluate and  update our code and standards annually to  address emerging risks, incorporate new legal  requirements and industry best practices, and  reflect the needs of supplier employees in a  dynamic operating environment. we engage with a range of stakeholders, including rights- holders, civil society organizations, academic  experts, and program partners, to ensure  that our code and standards reflect current  internationally recognized labor, human rights,  health and safety, and environmental standards.  upholding our values from the start we work across our business to implement our  standards from the earliest stages of product  design and development — from the suppliers  we choose to work with, to the materials in our  products, to the

suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     been taken to prevent a reoccurrence. we  prohibit retaliation of any kind against supplier  employees who participate in our assessments. our goal is to work together with suppliers to  help them improve their management systems,  rather than to simply remove them from our  supply chain without helping them correct the  issues we have discovered. in the event that a  supplier is unwilling or unable to improve their  operations to meet our requirements, they risk  removal from our supply chain. since  , we  have directed the removal of   manufacturing  supplier facilities and   smelters and refiners  from our supply chain for being unwilling or  unable to sufficiently improve their operations  to meet our requirements. results of our assessments are detailed in our  people and environment in our supply chain  report  beginning on page  . a responsibility that   grows with our business as apple’s business continues to grow and  expand to new areas, we adapt our supplier  engagement model accordingly. this includes  continuing to expand our scope to conduct  independent, third-party assessments of a  growing number of suppliers that support  our business outside of manufacturing. last  year, we increased our engagement and  expanded the application of our code and  standards to suppliers supporting newer areas  of apple’s business, including those that work  with our content services like apple tv+ and  apple fitness+. supplier employees at final assembly in the u.s.how we stay

assessment or engagement, we take  prompt action so that suppliers not only correct  and remedy the issue, but make meaningful,  long-term changes to their systems and  processes. we do this through a corrective  action plan (cap), during which  -,  -, and   -day check-ins with apple are required.   we then conduct our corrective action  verification (cav) process to verify that all  corrective actions have been successfully  implemented, and necessary steps have code of conduct   assessments specialized   assessments investigations capability buildingongoing   trainingearly   engagement these assessments also include unannounced  assessments and unannounced visits  in response to workers’ grievances and  allegations, or to verify risks at supplier facilities  based on predictive

we are collaborating with industry associations,  civil society organizations, and multi- stakeholder initiatives around the world to  promote best practices, to listen to and learn  from others’ perspectives and experiences, and  to scale innovative solutions, helping everyone  to achieve progress at a more rapid pace. see  page   of the people and environment in our  supply chain report  for more detail on the  organizations we work with.labor and human rights   in the supply chain  people come first in everything we do. our  commitment to protecting the people in our  supply chain has been unwavering, anchored  by a simple set of beliefs: people deserve to be  treated with dignity and to know their rights.  they should be able to speak up if those rights  are not being respected — and to know and  expect that when they do, we will listen and act.  we’re committed to respecting the rights of every individual in our supply chain.we are committed to respecting the rights of  every individual in our supply chain — just like  we do for our team members, customers, and  other partners — and more broadly, to working  with others to share our tools and the lessons  we’ve learned, and to empowering everyone to  achieve progress more rapidly. listening to workers effective grievance channels, ongoing worker  management communications, and supplier  employee feedback are essential to ensuring  respect for worker rights and maintaining  safe and healthy workplaces. whether  through social dialogue and formal employee  representation, workplace satisfaction  surveys, anonymous hotlines, focus groups,  or interviews during annual assessments, the  feedback we receive directly from supplier  employees helps us ensure labor and human  rights are respected throughout our global  supply chain. we also use this feedback  to address emerging risks, improve rights  training for supplier employees and supplier  management, and to continually strengthen our  code and standards. • rights awareness:  we believe that  protection starts with rights awareness,  and since  , more than  .  million  supplier employees have been trained on  their workplace rights. under our code and  standards, suppliers are required to provide  employees with training on their workplace  rights. this training is generally conducted  during new employee orientation, and  covers international labor standards, local  labor laws, environmental health and safety,  and the protections required by our code  and standards• feedback channels: supplier employee  interviews are an important part of every  assessment conducted. each year, we  interview tens of thousands of supplier  employees in their local language and  without their managers present, to determine  whether or not their experience on the job  aligns with auditors’ observations during  assessments. in fiscal year  , despite  the ongoing challenges presented by  the covid-  pandemic, we interviewed   ,  workers in our supply chain — over   ,  more than were interviewed in the  previous fiscal year.   our code and standards require effective  worker feedback channels, including  grievance mechanisms, at all supplier sites.  we also provide third-party anonymous  hotlines, which are also available to our  employees (see page   ), and the ability to  contact the apple environment and supply  chain innovation (esci) team directly at any  time and in any language. when an issue is  raised, we require supplier management to  immediately investigate and to resolve the  issue in a timely manner.  in  , we launched a grievance hotline  awareness campaign, and its initial rollout  resulted in a   percent increase in utilization  of these third-party hotlines. the reports  we received from supplier employees via  hotlines in   included issues related to  wages and benefits, employee relations,  amenities at supplier facilities, workforce  stability, and health and safety. in each case,  we investigated and worked directly with the  suppliers to drive improvement and correct  any compliance issues found. suppliers  implemented a number of actions as a result  of supplier employee feedback through these  appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     channels, including improvements to working  hours, resignation processes, timing of  bonuses, and the use of personal protective  equipment (ppe). •  workplace satisfaction:  in addition to  interviews and grievance channels, we  also engage with supplier employees  to understand their overall workplace  satisfaction. in  , we anonymously  surveyed  ,  supplier employees in    facilities across greater china, india,  ireland, malaysia, philippines, singapore,  uk, u.s., and vietnam about their workplace  experiences — nearly double the number of  supplier employees surveyed last fiscal year.  as a result, suppliers took   actions,  including better commute options, increasing  wages and bonuses, offering better food  variety, and skill development opportunities  for entry-level managers. responsible labor recruitment our code and standards, and the protections  they provide, apply equally to all workers,  regardless of a person’s job, geographic  location, or how they enter our supply chain  — and this commitment begins even before  a worker ever enters our supply chain. this  includes zero tolerance for forced labor. we implement strict policies and procedures  with our suppliers to protect workers in our  supply chain from forced labor. this includes  selecting suppliers for assessments based  on factors, such as their geographic location,  which may put them at higher risk of forced  labor violations, as well as their previous  performance and/or history of violations or  allegations. suppliers may also receive additional  specialized assessments based on the nature  of their business or employee population, such  as those that employ foreign contract workers,  and those located in higher risk migration  corridors. our code and standards also require  that all supplier employees have an effective  mechanism to report grievances. in addition,  we provide third-party anonymous hotlines and  the ability to contact the apple environment and  supply chain innovation (esci) team directly at  any time and in any language. when an issue  is raised, supplier management is required to  promptly investigate and to resolve the issue in a  timely manner. we strictly prohibit any form of involuntary labor  throughout our worldwide supply chain and look  for evidence of it in every supplier assessment  we conduct, including unannounced  assessments. last year, we conducted more  than   assessments, and found no instances  where anyone was forced to work in our  supply chain. we did discover two cases in taiwan in which  people paid recruitment fees to secure their  job, which is a violation of our code. we  required the supplier to directly repay their  employees in full, and verified repayment  through a third-party auditor. the payment of  recruitment fees, withholding an employee’s  passport or personal identity documents,  or restricting an employee’s freedom of  movement are core violations of our code  and standards — the most serious level of  code violations. if we discover workers have  paid recruitment fees at any point on their  employment journey to an apple supplier, we  require supplier management to take prompt  action to provide remedy to those affected  by directly repaying their workers for any and  all fees, even if the supplier was unaware  that their employees had paid recruitment  fees. from   through fiscal year  ,  our suppliers have repaid $ .  million in  recruitment fees directly to   ,  workers. finally, in collaboration with the international  organization for migration (iom) and the  responsible business alliance (rba), we  expanded our responsible labor recruitment  toolkit to more than   additional supplier  facilities in   countries, reaching nearly   ,   workers globally, with   percent of those  working on apple production lines. . m  supplier employees trained on their   rights since     ,  supplier employees directly engaged about  their workplace experiences, through  interviews and satisfaction surveys  ,  supplier

forced  labor in our  supply chain apple has zero tolerance for forced  labor. in the more than   countries  and regions where our suppliers  operate, we have teams of experts,  including independent third parties,  who monitor our suppliers and put in  place industry-leading procedures  to help ensure that no one is forced  to work. our comprehensive policies  start before we even sign a contract  with suppliers, and we are consistently  raising the bar.   we set the highest standards.   eliminating forced labor begins with setting  and maintaining the highest standards. our  standards often go above and beyond legal  requirements to protect people from forced  labor risks.  we engage early.   to address forced labor risks at its roots,   we know that our work has to begin before  people enter our supply chain.  we hold suppliers accountable.   once we’ve implemented thorough  preventative measures, independent,  third-party assessments verify that our  suppliers are meeting our standards.  looking for evidence of forced labor is part  of every supplier assessment. if we find any  violations of our code and standards, we  take swift action to remedy the issue and  improve their operations.   we track progress   and report transparently.   consistent improvement requires  transparency and accountability. since   , we have been publishing reports  on our efforts across all of our work  to transparently share our progress  and challenges.   we regularly engage and   partner with stakeholders.   engagement with stakeholders and rights  holders is critical to accountability, ensuring  we’re taking action where it’s needed, and to  achieving rapid progress.   aligning with international frameworks.   apple policies and our supplier requirements align with  international labor and human rights standards, including those  of the international labour organization, the united nations  guiding principles on business and human rights (ungps), and  the organisation for economic co-operation and development.  the apple human rights policy   our human rights policy outlines how we treat everyone,  including our customers, employees, business partners,   and the people across every level of our supply chain.   read the apple human rights policy   the apple supplier code of conduct and supplier  responsibility standards   our supplier requirements contain strict standards for  responsible labor recruitment, and apply to all suppliers,  protecting workers globally. we go above and beyond legal  requirements in many places by strictly prohibiting labor  recruitment in regions where we cannot conduct adequate   due diligence and by maintaining a zero recruitment fees policy,  because we believe no one should pay to secure a job.    read the apple supplier code of conduct   and supplier responsibility standards thorough mapping informs our strategy.   an effective strategy requires deep understanding of our  supply chain. to date, we have mapped over   labor  recruitment agencies that work with our suppliers across    countries.  a leading strategy requires leading tools.   the apple responsible labor recruitment toolkit, developed  in partnership with the international organization for  migration, provides suppliers and their labor agencies with  easy-to-use tools that help them effectively manage and  report data, mitigating forced labor risks before people even  enter our supply chain. in addition to providing hands-on  training, we are making these tools openly available for others  to use.  awareness is power.   we require our suppliers to provide their employees with  training on their workplace rights on their first day on the  job. this helps to ensure that every person is aware of  their rights and what to do if they’re not being respected,  which includes the ability to anonymously contact apple  directly. foreign contract workers, who make up a very  small percentage of people in our supply chain, also receive  training prior to leaving their home country, as well as upon  arriving in their destination country. to date, our suppliers  have provided workplace rights training to over  .  million  people. in addition, last year we directly engaged with over   ,  people in our supply chain to learn more about their  workplace experience.   investing in consistent improvement.   through our new supplier employee development fund,  we’re investing $ m to expand programs designed  to continue to improve the rights training experience,  worker voice platforms, and supplier employee education  opportunities. a close look.   we regularly conduct independent, third-party assessments,  including surprise assessments, of our suppliers, verifying  compliance with over   points across our standards. this  includes an extensive document review to be sure all hiring  and personnel records are in place and accurate. in addition  to specialized forced labor assessments for at-risk suppliers,  we also require many suppliers to participate in facility-wide  assessments, such as the validated assessment program,  to verify performance across the supplier’s entire business.  in the event that we find gaps in a supplier’s compliance  or capabilities, we require them to implement a corrective  action plan. to date, our assessments have covered    percent of our direct manufacturing spend.   we investigate every report.   in addition to thoroughly assessing our suppliers’ performance  in upholding our standards, we also receive reports from the  press, governments, civil society, and people in our supply  chain, and we encourage the public to report concerns via  https://www.apple.com/uk/supplier-responsibility/. we  investigate every report, and frequently have apple teams  onsite within   hours.   swift action and steep penalties.   forced labor in any form is a core violation (the most serious  violation level) of our requirements. if a core violation is  discovered, the supplier’s ceo is notified and the supplier  is immediately placed on probation, pending the successful  completion of a corrective action plan. probation can include  no new projects, no new business, and termination of existing  business. in addition to commercial penalties, if a supplier is  unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they risk removal  from our supply chain. since  , we have directed the  removal of   manufacturing supplier facilities and    smelters and refiners for failure to meet our requirements.   action this year.   in fy , across more than   assessments, we found  no instances where anyone was forced to work in our  supply chain. we did find two cases where employees of  the same supplier in taiwan paid recruitment fees. per our

safety among many topics, our code and standards  cover the safe handling of chemicals,  emergency preparedness, health and safety  permits, living and working conditions, and  incident management. health and safety is  also an important part of every assessment we  conduct. any instances of noncompliance with  our code and standards during an assessment  are addressed through customized corrective  action plans, online training materials, and  capability building with ehs experts in order  to improve their future performance. in  ,  we began development of a safety culture  guide to help suppliers cultivate a deeper, more  sustainable culture of safety in their facilities.  health and wellness beyond keeping people in our supply chain  safe, we’re committed to creating workplaces  where people can thrive. this means giving our  supplier employees the tools and resources to  improve their physical and mental health and  well-being. since  , we’ve helped make health  education

and skill development opportunities  to more people in our supply chain and surrounding communities. part of this  commitment will support new and expanded  labor programs reaching more than  .  million  supplier employees in over   countries,  aided by our strategic partners, including the  international labour organization (ilo) and the  international organization for migration (iom).  as part of this fund, we also launched the  apple education hub, informed by our previous  supplier employee learning and development  programs, which   million supplier employees  have taken advantage of since  . in  partnership with local educational institutions  and ngos, the apple education hub will  provide a scalable solution through virtual- first learning, to promote and develop the  skills necessary for the future of work in our  supply chain and surrounding communities.  with initial programming to begin in the  apple’s $  million supplier employee development fund will expand access to learning opportunities and skills  development for people across its supply chain.using our purchasing power for good for apple, our work to make our company more inclusive extends to how we  choose the businesses we work with. when contracting with suppliers, we use our  purchasing power to increase diversity in our supply chain and change outdated  norms that hurt those who are underrepresented in their field or industry.  apple’s award-winning supplier diversity program, established in  , actively  engages suppliers from historically underrepresented communities.  we have policies and procedures that require diverse supplier participation during  early-stage sourcing, key performance indicators to measure company success,  and diversity awareness trainings for our global sourcing team members and related  apple business units.  in  , apple was the first silicon valley–based company to be invited   into the billion dollar roundtable (bdr) in recognition of our long-standing   commitment to promoting diversity within our supplier base. bdr celebrates  corporations that achieved spending of at least $  billion with minority- and   woman-owned businesses.  in calendar year  , apple spent over $ .  billion with diverse suppliers around the  world. our supplier diversity program offers support to participating suppliers and  seeks active engagement in industry diversity leadership activities. for example,  supplier development has been a long-standing commitment within apple’s supply  chain, which is facilitated internally and externally. externally, we partner with major  universities to provide executive development and capacity building to key diverse  suppliers. and we’re proud to have supported michigan state university and  howard university on creating their first programs for diverse supplier development. a highlight of   was that for the first time we engaged diverse suppliers   in north america in manufacturing accessories for some of apple’s most well- known products.  we’re also promoting diversity in the companies with which we do business.  for example, our agreements with our primary construction suppliers require  the reporting of their efforts to include diverse subcontractors on all apple- related projects.  as a result of our efforts, we were chosen as corporation of the year by the national  minority supplier development council (nmsdc) in october  . this award is  nmsdc’s highest honor to a major corporation for the utilization of ethnic minority- owned suppliers, specifically those with asian-indian, asian-pacific, black,  hispanic/latinx, and indigenous owners. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     apple helps suppliers rapidly accelerate renewable   energy use around the world in april  , apple announced that its suppliers more than doubled their use  of clean power over the last year, with over   gigawatts operational today out  of nearly   gigawatts in total commitments in the coming years. in  , these  renewable projects avoided  .  million metric tons of carbon emissions. the  projects online today will support greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to  removing   million cars from the road for one year. apple is constantly working with its global supply chain to accelerate and  support its transition to clean energy. as of march  ,   of the company’s  major manufacturing partners have pledged to power all apple production with  renewable electricity across   countries. the dozens of new commitments  announced this year will accelerate progress toward apple’s   goal to  become carbon neutral across its entire supply chain. u.s., china, india, and vietnam, more than   ,  supplier employees will participate  in new learning opportunities by   — from  leadership training and technical certifications,  to classes on coding, robotics, and advanced  manufacturing fundamentals. internal leadership   and technical programs we work consistently to provide meaningful  educational opportunities that enrich supplier  employees’ workplace experiences and provide  opportunities to improve career paths. over the  past five years, more than   students have  participated in our line leader, automation  technician, and general apprenticeship  programs. these programs give participants  the skills they need to pursue opportunities in  highly technical roles. in  ,   supplier  employees at   supplier sites participated  in technical training, including programs on  robotics, computer numerical control (cnc)  machines, and mobile device repair. coding  since  , we’ve offered training to supplier  employees on apple’s swift coding language  — a skill that is in high demand. in  , we  continued to build on feedback from students  and suppliers to refine our curriculum by adding  more opportunities for virtual learning while  maintaining the quality and consistency of  the programs.environment human rights and environmental protection  are inextricably linked. and we’re taking action  accordingly. as we build products that enrich  the lives of people around the world, we have  a profound responsibility to do so in a way that  minimizes our resource use while protecting the  local environments and communities where we  and our suppliers operate. we work with our suppliers to help us address  our environmental commitments, including our  goal to become carbon neutral by   across  our entire product footprint. our supplier energy  efficiency program and supplier clean energy  program both address direct and indirect  emissions in our supply chain, while our supplier  clean water and zero waste programs help to  reduce resource usage. in addition, our code contains strict  environmental protections, which require our  suppliers to understand and take active steps  to reduce their environmental impact while also  becoming better stewards of the resources  we all share and the communities in which  we operate. specifically, our code addresses  the management of regulated substances,  stormwater, wastewater, air emissions, waste,  and noise, as well as pollution prevention,  resource reduction, and obtaining necessary  environmental permits. more detail about our environment work in the  supply chain is

 at apple, our north star is creating technology that empowers people and enriches  their lives. teams across apple are always innovating to make technology that’s  even better for our users — that protects their right to privacy, that’s durable and  resilient, and that’s inclusive and accessible for everyone. and wherever we meet  our customers — online, over the phone, or in person — we’re committed to treating  everyone with dignity and respect.  we believe that technology should be a force for good in the world. it’s why we  partner with students and educators using technology to teach and learn in new  ways, and collaborate with doctors and researchers to uncover new insights that help  people live healthier lives. every day, we work to infuse the technology we make with  the values that define us. responsibility for integrating privacy,  accessibility, inclusion, education, and health  into our products and services cuts across  many teams, including hardware engineering,  software engineering, hardware technologies,  machine learning and ai, and environment,  policy and social initiatives. because we care about our customers, we  also have programs in place to understand and  support their needs. we work to provide positive  customer experiences as well as products  that are durable and can be used for years to  come. and when we design our products, we’re  focused on making them safe for anyone who  assembles, uses, or recycles them.privacy privacy is a fundamental human right, and  we’re constantly innovating to give users more  transparency and control over their data. it’s  why we set the industry standard for minimizing  data collection and processing a user’s  data on-device, and build industry-leading  transparency and controls into our technology.our approach delivering exceptional products that enrich  the lives of our customers is core to apple’s  business. we have enormous potential to help  people use technology to overcome barriers  to their goals, innovate to solve problems, and  expand access to critical needs like health and  education. with our products and services,  we’re uniquely positioned to both empower  our customers to take action as well as to drive  positive impact on some of the biggest issues  in our society today, including those addressed  by the un sustainable development goals  (see  page   ). equally important, we have a responsibility  to manage the environmental footprint of  our products and services (see page   ) and  understand their impacts on customers’ rights  as set out in our human rights policy. across  our products and services, we consider how  we respect human rights, including privacy,  freedom of expression, non-discrimination,  accessibility, health, education, a clean  environment, and safety. our human rights  due diligence (see page   ) helps us identify  and manage salient human rights risks across  our current portfolio, as well as look ahead to  fast-evolving areas like machine learning and  artificial intelligence (ai). appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     hand in hand with the privacy of our users are  our commitments to free expression and access  to information. our products and services help  our customers learn, express their creativity,  exercise their ingenuity, communicate privately  and securely, and share information globally,  whether by text message, audio, or sign  language over facetime video. designed for privacy our products and services are built with  innovative privacy technologies and techniques  designed to minimize how much of your data  apple — or anyone else — can access. they  contain features designed and implemented  over decades to protect customers’ privacy   and give them control over their information.safari was the first browser to block third- party cookies by default as far back as  ,  and in  , safari added intelligent tracking  prevention to further limit tracking while  still enabling websites to function normally.  random identifiers ensure that routes  customers take and the places they search  in maps are not associated with their apple  id, and messages and facetime are end-to- end encrypted, so apple can’t eavesdrop on  user communications. siri was designed from  the very beginning in   to not associate  the things that users say to siri with their  apple id, but instead uses a random identifier  generated when a user first enables siri. that  has remained the same since then, and in   , with newly introduced on-device speech  recognition, the audio of users’ siri requests  is processed right on their iphone or ipad  by default. throughout the app store ecosystem, we  continue to add innovative new features that  advance user privacy even further. privacy  nutrition labels require developers, including  apple, to report their data collection and  privacy practices in a standardized format. and  app tracking transparency requires developers  to obtain a user’s permission to track their  data across apps or websites owned by other  companies for use in advertising or shared with  data brokers. apple’s privacy policy ensures that privacy  remains a top priority in all that we do. our  suppliers are also obligated to apply our privacy  principles via our contractual terms. we respect  users’ ability to know, access, change, transfer,  restrict, and delete personal data, and we  strive to collect the minimum amount of data  necessary to power our products and services. customers control what information is shared,  where it’s shared, and when it’s backed up.  we do not provide user information to any  third parties without a clear legal basis, and  we publish a transparency report  detailing  government requests for customer data and  app removal. users can exercise their privacy rights at  our dedicated data and privacy page,   privacy.apple.com , where they can receive  a copy of the personal data that apple holds on  them across all of their interactions with us and  request deletion or temporary deactivation of  their account if they wish. apple is committed to delivering advertising in a  way that respects user privacy. apple -delivered  ads may appear on the app store, apple news,  and stocks depending on the jurisdiction.  the apple advertising platform does not track  users, nor does it buy or share user personal  information with other companies. to continue raising awareness and educating  people on how to protect their personal  information, on data privacy day in january    we shared a report that illustrates how  companies track user data across websites  and apps. and in june   we shared another  report exploring how apple’s security layers  and the app review process protect users and  keep them in control of their data. privacy governance to keep privacy at the center of our work, we  maintain rigorous

privacy questions, concerns, or complaints can  be raised online or by calling our apple support  number. our data protection officer is available  for questions regarding the privacy policy or  general privacy practices. embedding security and privacy we’ve spoken out, time and again, for strong  encryption without backdoors, recognizing  that security is the foundation of privacy. we  build security into our hardware, software,  and services, including at the design and  development phase, to provide users with  maximum security and a transparent user  experience, serving the ultimate goal of keeping  personal information safe. and we’ve designed  the secure enclave — a dedicated secure  subsystem integrated into apple hardware  — to keep sensitive user data, like biometric  information, secure.as part of our commitment, our apple security  bounty rewards researchers who discover  and share with us critical issues in our latest  operating systems and the techniques used  to exploit them.  apple also uses administrative, technical, and  physical safeguards to protect users’ data,  taking into account the nature of that information  and the threats posed. apple employees who  handle personal information are only permitted  to use approved software and collaboration  tools. our employees handling personal data  are required to undergo dedicated privacy  training, which is updated on an ongoing basis  to take into account new laws and privacy  developments. all our employees can raise  any privacy issues and questions with our  data protection officer, who is mandated to  raise any issues of concern to apple’s privacy  steering committee. when we become aware of a potential  data security incident, we conduct prompt  investigations and

the people  detection feature in magnifier uses camera,  lidar scanner, and on-device machine  learning to help support health and safety for  users who are blind or have low vision and need  to maintain social distancing.  hearing to support customers who are deaf or hard of  hearing , apple was the first to directly connect  hearing aids or a cochlear implant to iphone  and other ios devices through the made for  iphone (mfi) program. this enables customers  to make phone calls and stream high-quality  audio directly to their mfi hearing devices. and  in  , apple added support for the latest  generation of bidirectional hearing aids from  made for iphone partners that support hands- free phone and facetime conversations.  sound recognition notifies users of external  environmental sounds like running water, alarms, electrical appliances, breaking glass,  and more, with the newly introduced option  to train your iphone or ipad to listen for a  specific alarm or electrical appliance sound.  other features include live captions (beta),  introduced in  , which helps users with  hearing disabilities follow along with calls and  media on iphone, ipad, and mac; sign language  prominence in facetime, which can detect  when someone uses sign language in group  calls; and conversation boost for airpods pro,  which helps users better hear conversations in  crowded or noisy environments.  mobility users with limited mobility can use switch  control to navigate their device with a variety  of switches, including head-tracking, back  tap, sound actions, and certified mfi switches.  voice control helps a user control a device  with voice commands across iphone, ipad,  and mac. on apple watch, assistivetouch  for apple watch helps users with upper-body  limb differences to enjoy the benefits of apple  watch without having to touch the display. and  apple watch mirroring, introduced in  ,  supports users with quadriplegia or other  physical and motor disabilities in controlling  apple watch via iphone using assistive features  such as switch control and voice control.  ipados supports third-party eye-tracking  devices, making it possible for people to  control ipad using just their eyes. with touch  accommodations, customers can control  how long they touch the screen before it’s  recognized and whether repeat touches are  ignored, while back tap lets users double- tap or triple-tap the back of their iphone to  automatically perform a range of custom tasks,  from opening an app to taking a screenshot.cognitive our products are built with an array of features  to support people who are neurodivergent or  have cognitive disabilities. background sounds  help minimize distractions and support users  who want to focus, stay calm, or rest. with  speak selection for ios and macos, audio  can be used to support reading or writing  comprehension, and dictation and siri help  anyone who finds speaking easier than typing  or writing. another feature, guided access,  limits a device to a single app and lets users  control which features are available. the people detection feature in magnifier uses the lidar camera in iphone   pro, iphone   pro, and ipad pro to  help support health and safety for users who are blind or have low vision and need to maintain social distancing. community support apple offers extensive support

france. external engagement apple subscribes to the principle of  participation — “nothing about us without  us” — used by disability organizations to call  for inclusion in work done for, by, and with  persons with disabilities. in addition to hiring  people with disabilities to develop and inform  our accessibility features, we welcome all users  to beta test features and give feedback.we work with various nonprofit organizations  around the globe to strategically align and  support each other, and we maintain constant  contact with community organizations to  help ensure that we are exceeding their  expectations. we also work with international  standards organizations to expand equal  access to information and functionality while  working to protect and improve the rights,  inclusion, and equity of people with disabilities.  apple follows policy developments and shares  its best practices with regulators, governments,  and organizations, including the world health  organization (who) and the european  disability forum (edf). working with the world federation of the  deaf, the american council of the blind, the  cerebral palsy foundation, and the national  association of the deaf, apple proposed the  adoption of accessibility-themed emoji to  the unicode consortium, the global body in  charge of setting character standards across all  computing platforms. in  , the consortium  adopted apple’s recommendation for more  inclusive and representational emoji. and in   , we expanded the accessibility options for  memoji to include cochlear implants, an oxygen  tube, and a soft helmet. inclusive design building on our accessibility work, we’ve  always believed that in order to create the most  personal technology in the world, we must  consider the full range of human experiences.  all across apple there is a sustained  commitment to making products more inclusive  for a wide range of diverse groups. apple engineers work hand in hand with teams across  the business to help solve unique problems  others seldom think about.  for example, with ios  . , siri no longer has a  default voice, allowing users to choose the voice  that speaks to them when they first set up their  device, and in english, users can now select  more diverse voice options. we’re also taking  steps to ensure equity in our cameras’ automatic  person recognition features so that everyone  can have the same extraordinary experience,  no matter the photographic subject’s skin color,  age, or gender. as a result, the machine learning  models used in camera technology must show  similar performance across various age groups,  genders, ethnicities, skin tones, and other  attributes. we’ve also published  research   on this work  to help others learn from it. beyond our own products and services,  we’ve developed machine learning research   and human interface guidelines  to support  developers in building inclusive apps that  put people first by prioritizing respectful  communication and presenting content and  functionality in ways that everyone can access  and understand. some of the characteristics  to consider include age, gender and gender  identity, race and ethnicity, language and culture,  and social and economic context, among  others. we also provide tools, documentation,  sample code, and design best practices  to help  developers make their apps more accessible.  we launched two videos during our worldwide  developers conference (wwdc) in june    on the process and practice of inclusive  design that were among the most popular of the  week: the process of inclusive design  and the  practice of inclusive  design .a preview of innovative accessibility features combining   the power of hardware, software, and machine learning in may  , we previewed software features coming later this year that offer users  with disabilities new tools for navigation, health, communication, and more. using  advancements across hardware, software, and machine learning, people who are blind   or low vision can use their iphone and ipad to navigate the last few feet to their destination  with door detection; users with physical and motor disabilities who may rely on assistive  features like voice control and switch control can fully control apple watch from their  iphone with apple watch mirroring; and the deaf and

users about how using apple watch  for health and fitness has changed their lives.  these range from users who found closing their  activity rings every day motivated them to be in  the best shape of their lives to those alerted to  a potential irregular heart rhythm who sought  medical care to confirm. stories like those  continually drive us to do more for our users. building on innovative features for apple watch  like the ecg app, irregular rhythm notifications,  and fall detection, apple recently introduced  a variety of services and features to help  people on their health and fitness journeys.  apple fitness+ is an award-winning fitness  and wellness service powered by apple watch  and designed to be welcoming to all, wherever  they are in their journey. fitness+ helps users  train their body and mind with a personalized  and engaging experience that can be done  anytime, anywhere; intelligently incorporates  workout metrics from apple watch right on  the screen; and motivates users from start  to finish with music from today’s top artists.  features like handwashing, sleep, and blood  oxygen offer more insights into users’ overall  wellness to make more informed decisions for  themselves. apple watch users can also view  a classification of their cardio fitness level  — a powerful predictor of overall health — in  the health app, and receive a notification if it  falls within the “low” range. the breakthrough  technology allows users to better understand  their cardio fitness measurements taken right  from their own wrist. appendix

engineers in our reliability testing lab who  measure the performance of materials,  components, and fully assembled products. we continue to design our products with  features that enhance repairability and  durability. for instance, we’ve continued   to increase the number of repairable modules  on iphone while also adding durability features  like water resistance.  making repairs more convenient if a repair is needed, we believe our customers  should have convenient access to quality   repair services to get their product back up   and running as quickly as possible. over the past three years, we’ve nearly doubled  the number of service locations with access  to genuine apple parts, tools, and training,  offering more ways for consumers to get  repairs. these repair options include apple  store locations, apple authorized service  providers (aasp), participating independent  repair providers, mail-in repair centers, or  onsite service and, starting in  , self  service repair. our repair network has grown  to over   aasp locations and over    independent repair providers around the world  — in addition to our   apple retail locations.visit our families site

long-lasting products are best for  the environment. we also believe products that  minimize the need for repair or replacement  encourage our customers to come back to  apple. we design our products with this goal  in mind. appendix governance communities suppliers customers our people environment introduction apple’s   esg report     apple’s safety compliance policy defines  procedures to monitor products in the field and  investigate potential safety issues. this policy  requires escalation of safety issues to apple  management and timely reporting to regulators  where necessary. it also requires mechanisms  for employees to confidentially report safety  or compliance concerns, as well as training for  employees on how to address the concerns.  our product integrity and legal teams are  responsible for ensuring that apple’s safety  compliance policy is followed.we collect devices for refurbishing and reuse  through several programs, including apple  trade in, the iphone upgrade program,  applecare, and our corporate hardware  reuse program. in fiscal year  , we sent   .  million devices and accessories to new  owners for reuse. our trade in program extends  to   countries, providing customers with  options for product end-of-life — to access  the value of their current device if they want to  upgrade to a newer model, or to recycle their  devices for free. product safety we design our products to make sure they’re  safe for anyone who assembles, uses, or  recycles them. commitment to safety  the well-being of those who design, make, use,  and recycle our products is a priority for apple,  which is why we’re committed to using safer  materials to create safer products. we assess  the health and safety of all our products, during  every stage of their life cycle — from early  concept development, through use, service,  and repair, to recycling. during the design and  prototyping process, cross-functional apple  teams analyze potential failures and their  effects from a quality and safety perspective.  the results drive product design improvements  and manufacturing process controls. apple is committed to helping customers  understand how to safely use apple  products. apple’s product user manuals   include important safety and handling  information, and apple offers additional topical  content to provide tips and help customers  understand features. for example, apple published articles to make  sure customers with potential skin sensitivities   understand what materials are used in  our wearable products. we also explained  how to clean and disinfect  apple products,  and provided guidance on keeping apple  products with magnets a safe distance from  medical devices. safety compliance  apple’s products are designed, tested, and  certified to comply with international and  regional safety standards. they also meet our  own specifications, which often go above and  beyond what is required. for example, apple’s  regulated substances specification restricts  the use of certain chemical substances in apple  products, and we apply rigorous additional  controls for materials that may have prolonged  contact with the skin. components that are  critical to safety are subject to enhanced  requirements and additional supplier audits. apple tracks customer reports of potential  product safety issues, and employees  are trained on how to handle, document,  and properly escalate such reports. apple  investigates reported incidents and also  analyzes products for potential safety issues.   in the rare event that apple determines a  product poses a potential safety risk, we take  action to recall the product, which includes  notifying customers and helping customers  have their products repaired, replaced,  or refunded. apple products also help customers in emergencies   and in caring for their well-being, with features like  emergency calling, fall detection, medical id, and  hearing health notifications.  keeping our products current   with software updates apple provides free software upgrades to  improve our customers’ experience and help  our products last longer. our customers can  count on the latest software features and  security updates to their existing devices for  years. we continually improve the operating  systems that power our products and engineer  each software release to run seamlessly on all  supported devices. extending the life of products and parts  through refurbishment and reuse we can lower the impact each device has on  the environment — including carbon intensity  per year of life — by finding ways to refurbish  and reuse these products. and by building our  products to serve more than one owner and  encouraging customers to

racism and support  opportunities for black, hispanic/latinx, and  indigenous communities. our racial equity  and justice initiative (reji) is focused on three  key areas: expanding access to education,  supporting criminal justice reform, and  removing economic barriers for communities  of color. the initiative began in june   with an  initial commitment of $  million, followed  by an additional $  million commitment in  august  , to help elevate equity-focused  solutions across the academic and advocacy  landscapes, and a $  million commitment  in may   to expand access to capital for  community financial institutions supporting  communities of color. reji has spurred new partnerships and projects  while inspiring us to weave a focus on equity  and justice into everything we do — including  our existing community programs   and business operations. education: greater access   and greater opportunity reji builds on our long-standing commitment  to education and works hand in hand with our  community education initiative ( page   ).  historically black colleges and universities  (hbcus), hispanic-serving institutions (hsis),  and tribal colleges and universities (tcus)

institutions and nonprofit  organizations — including   hbcus — in over    different locations across   states in the  u.s. and four locations across the uk since the  initiative launched in  . grounded in the positive relationships that  we’ve established with these organizations,  we’re working to deepen our impact in  three areas: educator development:  we’re providing  educator development and training  opportunities to build the knowledge and  skills that educators need to teach coding  in underrepresented communities through  teacher coding academies and the cei  learning series. these programs allow  hundreds of teachers from around the u.s.  to meet virtually and in person to share  best practices for integrating and teaching  coding and creativity concepts. through  our academies and cei learning series,  we’re connecting cei educators with apple  distinguished educators from all around the  world. apple distinguished educators lead and  participate in learning workshops, along with  our apple professional learning specialists. out-of-school-time learning:  we’re  partnering with nonprofits, ngos, and  community-based organizations that provide  out-of-school-time learning experiences  to increase exposure, awareness, and  experiences through coding and creativity.   a new collaboration between apple and boys & girls clubs of america will

clubs of america  launched a new collaboration to bring coding  with swift to tens of thousands of students  across the u.s., building on apple’s existing  partnership with the organization to use  ipad and apple’s free everyone can code  curriculum. and in canada, we’ve supported  learning for indigenous people through an app- based literacy assessment tool, which drove  significant literacy outcomes, encouraged a  community-based approach, and provided  learning activities for children to build oral skills.  in addition, we partnered with the assembly  of first nations on an interactive collection of  apple books that explore canadian history   from an indigenous perspective. apple developer academy as the ios app economy continues to grow,  we’re investing in educational programs and  opportunities that prepare learners of all ages  and backgrounds for the jobs of the future. in  , we started the apple developer  academy to empower entrepreneurs, creators,  and coders by helping them cultivate the skills  necessary to pursue new career opportunities.  the program focuses on communities with  high youth unemployment and is open to  anyone, regardless of academic background  or experience. we seek to spark interest among the next generation of developers and  bring diverse representation to the growing  app ecosystem, particularly among women  and individuals from underrepresented  communities. a larger and more diverse  developer community helps create more new  ideas and businesses, and it gives more people  access to employment and opportunities for  economic mobility. some participants are also  undertaking practical projects in collaboration  with ngos to help use technology to solve  challenges related to their missions, which  amplifies impact even further. we offer two distinct training programs as part  of the apple developer academy:  )  -day  foundations courses that cover specific topic  areas, including an introductory course for  those considering app development as a career  path, and  ) a more intensive academy program  of at least   to   months that dives deeper  into coding and professional skills. in addition  to partnering with institutions, the academy  works closely with employers to provide direct  pathways to career opportunities. participants  also have access to a strong alumni network   as they move forward in their careers. as of april  , we have   foundation  programs and   academy programs across  the globe working in close collaborations with  institutions that provide content and experience  opportunities. the programs are based in seven  countries with over   participants in total   in calendar year   — and more than    ,  since the inception of the apple  developer academy in  .  on

participants receive one-on-one code-level  guidance on their apps from apple experts  and engineers, as well as support, inspiration,  and insights from top apple leaders. the core  programming is based on developer labs at  wwdc, where participants work on improving a  specific app in bespoke, one-on-one sessions  with apple engineers and experts. the program  also includes community sessions, networking,  and opportunities for ongoing support. after  the lab concludes, participants become part  of a growing community of other exceptional  alumni who can help them build their business.

friendship. the program equipped the authors with apple  technology, including ipad pro, apple pencil, and magic keyboard, so they could  continue to share their stories and explore new media for creative expression in  illustration and audio.  for many of the students, who had neither imagined they’d write books nor  worked in these apps prior to the program, the sessions sparked inspiration for  future endeavors and opened doors to new modes of storytelling. through an  apple grant, shout mouse press was also able to further support the students’  post-program journey with scholarship funding for authors applying for college  and post-secondary programs. the books these students authored can be  enjoyed and downloaded for free on apple books. joy ugwu (pictured), a participant of

engages with stakeholders as part of   our commitment to advance meaningful change  and find novel solutions to pressing challenges.  every day, at all levels of the business, we  interact with a variety of stakeholders to  listen and learn from others’ perspective and  experiences, share our progress, and promote  best practices. stakeholders provide valuable  expertise as we develop our programs, and by  collaborating with other stakeholders, we can  drive more impact on the issues we care about  than any one of us could make on our own. throughout the year, we proactively engage  with a wide range of stakeholders and rights  holders, including: our people we believe that open and honest communication  among team members, managers, and  leadership fosters an open, collaborative work  environment where everyone can participate,  develop, and thrive. our peoples’ voices and  ideas drive innovation in everything we do  — from informing diversity initiatives to the  inclusive benefits that support employees of  all backgrounds through every life stage. in  addition to managers listening to their teams,  we conduct surveys to better understand team  member views across key topics, and we provide  channels for employees to share concerns  with leadership. read more in our people on  page   . suppliers whether through social dialogue and  formal employee representation, workplace  satisfaction surveys, anonymous hotlines,  focus groups, or interviews during annual  assessments, the feedback we receive directly  from supplier employees helps us ensure  that labor and human rights are respected  throughout our global supply chain. we also  use this feedback to address emerging risks,  improve rights training for supplier employees  and management, and continually strengthen  our supplier code of conduct and supplier  responsibility standards. customers we’re motivated by creating the best user  experience through our products and in every  interaction with our customers. to help ensure  quality, we continually monitor customer  feedback, assess key drivers, and leverage  analytics to improve the customer experience.  customer feedback is shared with team  members as well as leaders, so that everyone  understands their impact and is focused on  making the customer experience the best   it can possibly be. see more on page   . ngos, multi-stakeholder

emissions from r&d processes.  . beginning in fy , we’re accounting for scope   emissions from the  purchase of district heating, chilled water, and steam.  . in fiscal year  , we started calculating scope   emissions not listed in  this table. in fiscal year  , these include electricity transmission and  distribution losses amounted to about  ,  metric tons co  e and life  cycle emissions associated with renewable energy amounted to about   ,  metric tons co  e. we have not accounted for emissions resulting  from employees working from home, because we anticipated these  emissions are small relative to our carbon footprint and we are still evolving  our methodology.   . we regularly revisit our methodology to hold ourselves to high accountability  standards. so in fiscal year  , we changed how we calculate emissions  from business travel in order to better account for classes of service in air  travel. as a result of this change, our scope   transportation emissions  increased by   percent between   and  . without the methodology  change, these emissions would have increased by   percent, which reflects  the growth in our business.  . beginning in fiscal year  , we updated our methodology to reflect the  impact of covid-  on employee commute.  . we retired  ,  metric tons of carbon credits from the chyulu hills project  in kenya to maintain carbon neutrality for our corporate emissions in fiscal  year  . this project is certified to the vcs and ccb standards.  . because we’re committed to accuracy and transparency, we regularly refine  our product life cycle assessment model and sources of data. for example,  we recently obtained more granular data summarizing in which countries our  products are sold and used, resulting in more granularity possible for grid  emission factors used in the carbon footprint of the product use phase. the   net result was an increase in our   carbon footprint. when using the  same level of data granularity and model as  , our product use carbon  emissions in   would have been about  .  percent lower.  . for fiscal year  , we retired credits from the chyulu hills project in kenya,  and purchased carbon credits from two additional projects to offset a total  of  ,  metric tons of direct emissions across our value chain. the first  project, a redd+ coastal conservation project in guatemala, protects and  conserves forests from deforestation and degradation. the second project   aims to establish forests on about  ,  hectares of barren land that is not  otherwise in use across seven counties in the guizhou province of china.  both projects are certified to the same high standards that we require for  projects in the restore fund, including vcs and ccbs. these projects are all  certified to the vcs and ccb standards.  . due to rounding, our gross and net carbon footprints do not always the sum  of the subtotals disclosed above.   notes: for data on previous years, please reference past environmental
