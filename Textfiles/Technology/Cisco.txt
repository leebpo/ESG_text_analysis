progress around esg efforts.    today, this report aligns with our company purpose—to power  an inclusive future for all—and it illustrates the many ways  cisco brings this to life. we remain committed to annually  sharing the impact we are making in critical areas such as  sustainability, inclusion and diversity, human rights, education,  economic development, and crisis response. the ways in  which we support our customers, care for our employees,   and serve our communities define our company today, just   as they did nearly two decades ago.  while no one could have predicted the challenges we’ve  faced over the last few years, one thing remains clear—cisco  plays an important role in not only helping our customers solve  their biggest business issues, but also making this world a  better place for all of us. setting clear goals and measuring  our progress keeps us accountable and allows us to share  what we are learning from our experience and work.  each day, we use our technology, expertise, and scale to drive  progress, whether that’s supporting our ukraine employees,  customers, and their communities affected by the war; delivering  on our social justice

reporting hub at cisco, pursuing our purpose—to power   an inclusive future for all—is a journey. what set us on this journey was our deep commitment,   and a deeply held responsibility, to leverage our unique  strengths and success as a company to improve people’s  lives, everywhere. we know we can harness the power of  connectivity, which is the foundation of everything we do,   to help address the challenges our society faces. we’ve been on this journey for many years, and we don’t  know the turns we’ll make, or the obstacles we’ll face along  the way. but our commitment to our purpose continues to  drive us forward, to respond in times of crisis, and to use   our technology, our people, and our networks to bridge the  digital divide, help address climate change, and open more  opportunities for more people.  following this journey means that we must question ourselves  and adjust along the way. how do we know we’re on the right  path? how do we know we’re making progress? what are we  measuring, and are those the right metrics?  as our work progresses, so too does our understanding of  what drives impact. we don’t always have the answers—in  fact, we know we’ll make mistakes. but we also know that  mistakes are part of improving and getting us closer to the  metrics that truly matter: the impact we’re making and the  lives we touch. while this report highlights impressive numbers, the human  stories behind them are the real victories. educating  .  million  students through cisco networking academy is a striking  statistic, but for the person who goes back to school because  of a course they took or the person who gets their first job  because of a certification it is not a statistic—it is life changing.  and with every person we impact, every school we connect,  every community we empower, we personify our purpose.  beyond the numbers and the statistics, that is our north star,  and it will continue to guide us. a message from  francine katsoudas as we move forward on our journey, we will continue to  challenge ourselves to drive greater impact. we will show up  to every challenge—business, social, and environmental—with  intention. we will consider the people we can lift up, and we  will take action for what we believe is right and just. we may  not always succeed, but we’re not wavering from our path or  our commitment. our customers,

using  our previous methodology, visit the historic ghg methodology  discussion in the strategy, goals and emissions data section  on our esg hub .     packaging efficiency is measured by comparing the size of the product relative to the packaging using dimensional weight.  dimensional weight uses volume and a standard dimensional factor to calculate the weight of a package. in this methodology,  the packaging efficiency metric is based on the difference of the normalized dimensional weight (by volume) between the  baseline and current year.    in fiscal  , we had a soft launch of the scoring tool to evaluate   percent of new products and packaging, and   percent  of them successfully met our circular design criteria. this is equivalent to   percent of total new products and packaging

net-zero goal align with  cisco’s purpose to power an inclusive  future for all? we can’t have any kind of future if we  don’t have a healthy planet. beyond that,  the promise of technology is that it enables  us to rethink business models in ways that  are digital and low-carbon, but also improve  individual wellbeing and create opportunities  for communities. one example is hybrid work,  which helps enable inclusion because it allows  us to include more people, and more work  styles, in more places. hybrid work can also  have environmental benefits, particularly when  combined with smart building technology that  uses sensors and low-voltage power over  ethernet. these innovations allow us to monitor  and control temperature, lighting, and air quality,  as well as reduce embodied carbon from steel  conduits and copper wiring. this is the kind of  digital, low-carbon, inclusive thinking we want  to accelerate—holistic solutions that benefit  business, people, communities, and the planet.why was now the right time for cisco   to set a net-zero goal? our world is at a tipping point. i think we’re  all seeing the impact of climate change,  whether in the form of hurricanes, flooding,  droughts, or fires. given the climate reality, it’s  time for societies to think beyond mitigation  and consider adaptation and regeneration as  well. this moment also presents an inflection  point for businesses. to survive in this new  reality, businesses must become not only  digital, but also low-carbon. cisco has   helped our customers accelerate their digital  transformations since our founding, and today  we have an opportunity to bring about a  low-carbon transformation through our global  reach as well.q aq aa net-zero  business is just  the beginning  mary de wysocki, cisco’s first chief  sustainability officer, shares the strides  the company has made not just toward  decarbonizing our own business—but bringing  customers, suppliers, and community partners  along for the journey.  future intro power inclusive     cisco purpose report  |  csr.cisco.com   |  esg reporting hub cisco has a long history of goal-setting— including more than a decade’s worth of  emissions goals—and rigorously reporting  on and validating those goals. why is  validation so important? it’s important to help validate our impact  through external verification because it  ensures that our actions are having the outcomes  we intend. cisco’s net zero by   goal achieved  validation from the sbti under its new net-zero  standard, which requires us to reduce our absolute  scope  ,  , and   emissions   percent by  .  the sbti also requires interim goals and annual  updates on progress that will keep us accountable. having an sbti-validated goal means that  you must address emissions across your  value chain, not just your own operations.  how do you approach reducing emissions  and driving transformation more broadly? helping our customers and suppliers meet  their own decarbonization goals is a critical  way that cisco will help bring about a digital and  low-carbon future. the use of cisco’s products  makes up the majority of our emissions footprint.  our engineers have made great progress in power  efficiency and circular design, and we’re also  seeing customers ask for more capabilities and  greater bandwidth that increase power demands.  that means we must think even bigger, exploring  ways to accelerate renewable energy adoption  and the greening of the grid. our second-largest  source of emissions is our supply chain. cisco has  set a goal that   percent of our top component,  manufacturing and logistics suppliers will set  public ghg emissions reductions targets by   , and we regularly share our learnings   with them.q a q acisco has practiced a social investment  strategy focused on early-stage solutions  for more than   years through the cisco  foundation. how will your experience in  this space support emissions reduction  beyond your value chain?  the cisco foundation—along with innovation  competitions we organize like the cisco  global problem solver challenge—helps  stimulate cutting-edge innovation in areas where  it’s most needed. today, the foundation focuses  on early-stage decarbonization technology and  nature-based solutions to climate change. these  investments send a signal to other investors  about what we value and where we believe the  future is headed. a recent cisco foundation grantee i’m particularly  excited about is seacology and its dominican  republic mangrove initiative , which supports  businesses that protect the country’s critical  mangrove forests. mangroves are known for  helping sequester carbon as well as protecting  coastlines from storm surges and sea level rise—   a great example of tackling both climate change  mitigation and adaptation at the same time. the  initiative also provides jobs for residents in  vulnerable coastal areas, building powerful  connections with members of these  communities and demonstrating the   importance of inclusion in the   low-carbon transition.q a photo credit: seacologyfuture intro power inclusive

esg reporting hub security, privacy  and trust data underlies nearly every aspect of how we  work, play, learn, and connect. the security  and privacy of data, therefore, is closely tied   to many of the world’s challenges. today, as teams increasingly work in a distributed fashion,  organizations need new ways to securely connect users,  applications, and things. threats such as ransomware and  exploitation of software vulnerabilities are increasingly  commonplace. cyberspace has become a new frontier in  global warfare. for example, since the russian invasion of  ukraine , cyber attacks against ukrainian users have surged.   in this environment, regulatory and consumer expectations    of companies regarding security, privacy, and trust are higher  than ever—and cisco is proud to be a leader in this space. as  a large, global enterprise, we must safeguard our business  and help customers do the same. our security products and  solutions provide the protection that businesses need. we   are also committed to sharing our perspective on matters of  security, privacy, and trust so that all organizations can operate  more safely. to this end, in fiscal  , cisco published the  new trust standard —a compilation of what we’ve learned from  our experiences securing and digitally enabling thousands of  customers around the world. while the building blocks of trust  will surely evolve further in response to changing customer  expectations, technology, cyber threats, and international data  governance, the new trust standard provides a framework  for trusted digital relationships today. our impact our commitment to transparency  governmental organizations at all levels around the world use  cisco technology. they also set policies and regulations that  determine how technology should operate. engaging with  policymakers, regulators, and government agencies on matters  related to security, privacy, and trust is an essential part of   our work. for example, we occasionally receive requests  for  data related to ongoing investigations from law enforcement,  intelligence agencies, or governments. when this happens, cisco  follows a strict set of policies and procedures  to help ensure  that data disclosures are minimized and controlled, and that  access to our solutions and services remains free from unlawful  intrusion. we publish data related to these requests, including  the number of requests by country and how many requests we  fulfill or reject, every six months in our transparency reports . on may  ,  , u.s. president joe biden signed an executive  order mandating more transparency in the software supply chain.  cisco stood ready to respond  to this order and supports the tech  industry’s adoption of software bills of materials (sboms). later  in the year, after a vulnerability was discovered in the apache  log j   open-source software, cisco senior vice president  and chief security and trust officer brad arkin spoke  to a

product lifecycle.valuing  privacy and  inclusion in  software  designwhen it comes to powering an inclusive future for all, respect   for human rights is a fundamental innovation principle. privacy,  security, and inclusion must be central in the design methodology,  especially when it comes to artificial intelligence and machine  learning. training data sets often determine how product design  and user experience take shape—the adage “goodness in, goodness  out” certainly applies. developers must take steps to ensure these  data sets are robust, diverse, and representative of all users.  failing to do so can result in inaccuracies, disappointing user  experiences, and unintended bias.   take, for example, webex virtual backgrounds, which are designed  to hide users’ surroundings to enhance privacy, security,  professionalism, and fun. early research versions of this feature,  which reflected the state of the art at the time, did not perform well  for certain hair textures and styles, or lighting conditions. in some  cases, they inadvertently filtered out portions of a user’s  appearance. our engineers recognized that broader, more diverse  training data sets that were representative of the webex user base  were required, and addressed this during the design phase before  releasing the feature. by applying data that was anonymized,  ethically sourced, user-contributed, open-source, provided with  explicit consent, and respectful of individual privacy in other ways,  we made the training data more robust. this resulted in more  representative images and algorithms, and a much better and more  inclusive user experience for all.   in  , we built on the learnings from the webex team and  launched our responsible ai framework based on six principles:  transparency, fairness, accountability, privacy, security, and  reliability. our responsible ai working group continuously drives  adherence to these principles by putting new technologies through  responsible ai impact assessments, offering guidance on how to  manage risk to human rights, and providing accountability via  incident reporting of human rights, privacy, and security concerns.

joint cyber defense collaborative. we   are steadfast in upholding our commitments to security and  privacy by design, anchored on the principles of transparency,  fairness, and accountability. at the same time, we are raising the  bar to meet new threats and current realities. for example, we  are taking steps to secure open-source software, responsibly  disclose vulnerabilities in our products and services, support  government and third-party initiatives to deliver more  trustworthy software, and enable data free flows with trust  (dfft) . we are also strengthening our capabilities to help  customers defend their critical infrastructure—like hospitals,  utilities, transportation, and government services—against  threats. protecting these essential functions amounts to  keeping as many organizations as possible above the   “cyber security poverty line .” sharing our expertise with all  we view security and privacy as an imperative for all  organizations. that’s why we work to share our knowledge  and solutions widely with our customers, industry associations,  and private- and public-sector organizations around the  world. for our employee base, cisco offers both required  security and privacy training to all employees and specialized  training and certifications for security and privacy professionals.  we share tips for users to keep themselves and their families  safe

the rapid pace of innovation.  we focus on striving to protect all groups, and particularly vulnerable ones,  from harm. these measures include auditing for proper treatment of people  working for our

looking across the value chain to help address human  rights impacts that we may be linked to through our business relationships.  we integrate human rights into our product design methodologies. for  example, ai/ml technologies have the potential to make sense of large  amounts of data more quickly and efficiently than humans can. but they can  also make mistakes that could harm human rights or erode customer trust.  in addition to cisco’s responsible ai framework, the responsible ai/ml  committee, also established in fiscal  , defines and directs governance  of the implementation and use of ai across our operations and solutions.  with this structure in place, we are now conducting assessments to help us  identify risks and consult with product teams as they work to address them.one of cisco’s   social justice  actions  is to embed a human  rights perspective into the daily  aspects of how we operate.   this includes incorporating  human rights into our corporate  governance,

the design of our products. when designing  new products, power and performance mean a constant  tradeoff. to reduce the emissions associated with the use  of our products, we are making improvements in four key  areas: power; thermal; high-speed interconnects and asics;  and integration into our customer facilities (read more in  the esg reporting hub ). in fiscal  , we completed our  energy efficiency goal, achieving   percent system  power efficiency in our large rack-mounted equipment,  as measured from the input power from the facility to the  board-mounted asics, memory, and other chip devices.  we reached this goal by focusing on three of our four  areas for improvement, including using high-efficiency  power supplies, optimizing asic power distribution, and  optimizing system power distribution. to accelerate the decarbonization of our value chain and  help our customers achieve their own sustainability goals,  we created a new engineering sustainability office in  fiscal  . this group works across cisco’s engineering  teams and in partnership with other functions to design  sustainable products, offers, and solutions, guided by one  roadmap with measurable results.  sustainable data centers data centers require ongoing energy  management to handle vast amounts  of data. in cisco lab tests, the new  nexus   series switches, built  using modular design and both   plus  titanium-rated and platinum-rated  power supplies, were shown to be    .  times more efficient than the    g gx-based nexus   series.hybrid work webex is our integrated solution that  creates

vehicles (evs) trying to charge at the same time.  vehicle-to-grid (v g) technologies could help reduce pressure  on electricity grids, especially during peak charging times. these  technologies would treat every ev like a battery that can supply  power back to a network or building. for now, v g is just a  concept—but a recent cisco partnership is helping bring it   closer to commercial reality.  the e-flex  project—a joint initiative between cisco’s country  digital acceleration  (cda) program, imperial college london,  and other partners—is proving the potential of v g with fleets of  vehicles owned by public and private-sector organizations. twenty  locations around the united kingdom were outfitted with two-way  charging stations from which data was collected. as a lead partner  on the project, cisco provided secure connectivity at the charging  stations through its umbrella cloud security solution, and cisco  meraki cameras added to physical security.  if it proves successful at scale, v g could become a critical part of  a lower-carbon future, as well as helping energy managers reduce  operational costs. this project provided a glimpse of what that future  could look like. “vehicles can act as local energy storage alongside  renewables,” says peter shearman, cisco head of innovation, united  kingdom and ireland. v g technology could be deployed at smart

packaging efficiency is measured by comparing the size of the product relative to the packaging using  dimensional weight. dimensional weight uses volume and a standard dimensional factor to calculate the  weight of a package. in this methodology, the packaging efficiency metric is based on the difference of  the normalized dimensional weight (by volume) between the baseline and current year.    in fiscal  , we had a soft launch of the scoring tool to evaluate   percent of new products and  packaging, and   percent of them successfully met our circular design criteria. this is equivalent to     percent of total new products and packaging released in fiscal   meeting circular design criteria.  in early fiscal  , the scoring tool was formally launched across all business units, so we expect the  universe of new products and packaging evaluated to increase in fiscal  .    the plastics included in this goal exclude those contained in commodity components sourced from  suppliers (e.g., plastic screws, fans, and cables).    according to current standard definitions used in certification protocols, “zero waste” diversion is defined  as a   percent or greater overall diversion of solid, nonhazardous wastes from landfill, incineration  (waste-to-energy), and the environment. diversion methods can include reduction,   reuse, recycling, and/or compost.visit cisco’s esg reporting
